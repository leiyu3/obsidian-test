## y-intercept Form
$$
y=mx+b
$$
$m$, the slope
$b$, the y-intercept

##  Standard Form
$$
ax+by+c=0
$$

Solving means to:
- find the value of $b$ and $m$

$$
\begin{align}
m&=\frac{-a}{b}\\
b&=\frac{-c}{b}
\end{align}
$$

## Special Cases
- Vertical Line: $x=k$
	- $m=\text{undefined}$
- Horizontal Line: $y=k$
	- $m=0$
	 - $b=k$

## Find slope ($m$)

$$
m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}=\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$
- if given two points on the line then:
$$
m=\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

- to solve graphically:
$$
m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}
$$
- Parallel means that the slope is the same
- Perpendicular means that the slope is Negative Reciprocal

## Find x-int
- set $y=0$ and solve for $x$
- look at the graph

## Find y-int
- set $x=0$ and solve for y
- look at the graph
