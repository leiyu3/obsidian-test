## Hello My Name is Busy
- *The Busy Christian's Guide to Busyness* , Tim Chester "[[Hurry Sickness|Hurry Sickness]]"
- Here, there and everywhere (1 King 20:40), but also no where
- In the modern age, we have way much more complexity and opportunity available to us than any other age.
	- Complexity:
		- "Adulting", car problem, jury duty, taxes, etc.
	- Opportunity:
		- can go anywhere, information, food, entertainment
### Dangers of Busyness
- Busyness can ruin our joy
	- Set margins in our life
	- busyness is like sin; kill it or it will be killing you
- Busyness can rob our heart [[Parable of the Soil|Parable of the Soil]]
	- worries of life, and things
- Busyness can cover up the rot in our souls
	- busyness as a way to cover up deeper heart problems

## The Killer P's
- Something is not right with us
- [[./Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis#8. The Great Sin||Mere Christianity on Pride]]
- People Pleasing: doing things in order to be loved by other (out of fear), than to simply serve others
	- afraid of saying "No"
- Pats on the back: receiving praise from others
- Performance Evaluation: we think we are irreplaceable. "they NEED me"
- Possession: we work to earn. We take pride in our possessions, and fail to trust that God will provide
- Proving myself: ambition for God's glory v.s. ambition for our glory
- Pity: we like the pity people give us when we share our burdens
- Poor planning: failing to delegate, and afraid to let others take your place because of pride
- Power: staying busy to stay in control
- Perfectionism: I can't let up because i can't make a mistake
- Position: I do a lot because that's what people like me are suppose to do
- Prestige: If I keep working, I will finally become someone.
	- "The only worse thing than to have failed at all of your dreams is to have all of them come true", What does it all matter if you don't have time to know and to be known by God?
- Posting: Social Media, for our name and fame

- Real life is tricky:
	- how do you distinguish between pride and love?
	- people pleasing or a humble servant?
	- is perfectionism wrong? should we not strive for excellence?
	- should we ignore cultural expectations?
	- does that mean we should never think about others?
- All those P vices can be turned into virtues with a minor tweak [[Total Depravity|Total Depravity]]

- Self diagnosis question:
	- "**Am I trying to do good or trying to make myself look good?**"
- Good Hospitality is being like a hospital. All you guest leave feeling helped and refreshed.
	- **Do good, instead of trying to look good.**

## The Terror of Total Obligation
- There's SO MUCH good stuff for us to be doing but we can't do them all!
- There are those that feel obligated to do more for God, but there is always more you can do.
- Ways to calm the storm:
	- *You are not the Christ*
	- *There is Good News*
	- *Care is not the same as, Do*
	- *We have different gifts and different callings*
	- *Remember the church*
	- *I can always pray right now*
	- *Jesus didn't do it all*
- Take time to be Holy
- Ephesians 5:16
	- a call to be holy instead of better time management
- Our circle of influence is smaller than our circle of concern

## Mission Creep
- Jesus was extremely busy, but not sinful
- urgent vs import [[Eisenhower Matrix|Eisenhower Matrix]]
- What is your priority? What is important to you? [[Focus|Focus]]
1. I must set priorities because I can't do them all
	- [[The Myth of Multitasking|The Myth of Multitasking]]
2. I must set priorities if I am to serve other most effectively
	- Having less on our plate allows us to give more effort to the few things we intent to do
	- "Setting things we will not do, until everything else is done"
	- In Acts when the disciples decided to get other faithful men to distribute food (Stephen)
	- Moses, delegating mens to settle affairs
	- Effective is different from efficient
3. I must allow others to set their own priorities

## A Cruel Kindergarchy
- Does parenting affect how the child will end up?
	- Will parenting ruin a child? Will parenting guarantee success for a child?
- Do parents overestimate how much their parenting affects the well being of their child?
- Parenting seems to do less in affecting the child's well being, especially in the long term. Nature > Nurture
- but it does affect how the children experience their childhood
	- Parent's are giving their child secondhand stress
- [[God's Sovereignty|God's Sovereignty]], We will parent imperfectly, our children will make their own choices and God will use all that for His glory

## Deep Call to Deep
- [[New Innovation New Problems|New Innovation New Problems]]
- [[Technology|Technology]]
- Dangers:
	- Addiction
		- [[The Shallows by Nicholas G. Carr|The Shallows by Nicholas G. Carr]]
		- 2 Peter 2:19
	- Slothfulness (Acedia)
		- apathetic passing of time
	- We are never alone (no alone time)
		- our desire to be not alone (always connected)
			- to distract us from ourselves [[Be Alone with God|Solitude]]
		- maybe mental health is God's megaphone? [[Pain|Pain]]
- Cultivate a healthy suspicion toward technology and progress
- Be more thoughtful and understanding in your connectedness with others
	- allow others time to reply
- Deliberately use "old" techonology
	- write with a pen, send a snail mail
- Make boundaries, and fight to protect them
- Bring our christian theology to bear these dangers of techonology
	- We can't have meaningful relationship with many
	- We can't be here and there
	- We do not look for our worth on the Internet

## Rhythm Blue
- "You'd better rest yourself before you wreck yourself!"
- [[Sabbath Rest|Sabbath]] was made for man
- we should rest in God alone for our salvation
- the Sabbath as a test for us to trust in His work rather than ours
- Both work and rest are good, just need to put them in their place.
- [[Theology of Work|Theology of Work]]
	- Prov. 6:6-11, Matthew 25:14-30, 1 Thess. 20:9; 4:11-12; 2 Thess. 3:10)
- [[Theology of Rest|Theology of Rest]]
	- Ex. 20:8-11, Deut 5:12-15; Psalm 127:2
- We started to mix work and rest together. How do we put them in the proper place?
- Psalm 127:2, God gives his beloved Sleep
	- Coffee doesn't mean you don't need sleep, it just you don't feel tired
	- Never get why people would do an all nighter, instead of just planning well. You lost the moment you needed to pull an all nighter
	- Elijah or Elisha -> cured his depression with Sleep and Food
- Rest is Hard Work ^7f84c5

## Embracing the Burden of Business
- the reason we are busy is because we are suppose to be busy
	- But we are to [[The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry by John Mark Comer|Eliminate Hurry]]
	- busy working on the wrong things
- We are suppose to struggle, not in heaven yet [[Pain|Pain]]
- Expect to suffer when you are committed to serving people
- 2 Cor. 11:28
- Response to the burden:
	- 2 COr 11:29
	- 1 Cor 1:27
	- 2 Cor 12:9

## The one thing you must do
- Devote yourself to the word of God and prayer
- Use your busyness to bring yourself close to Christ
- Luke 10
	- We do need Marthas to serve (Romans 12:7, 1 Pet. 4:11)
	- But Martha was worried and upset about many things (Titus 3:3)
	- Martha's busyness was not wrong, but it is not the best.
	- Martha was distracted
	- Are we giving Jesus our leftovers?

> [!Quote] J.C. Ryle A Call to Prayer
> A man may preach from false motives. A man may write books, and make fine speeches, and seem diligent in good works, and yet be a Judas Iscariot. But a man seldom goes into his closet, and pours out his soul before God in secret, unless he is serious.

- we need to really believe that spending time with God is really worth it, that it is the best part of our day
- Ministry is good and all, but don't miss the best part which is sitting at the feet of Jesus regularly
- Deut 8:3
