The chapters are small and contained. 
C.S. Lewis is a great thinker
Gives an argument to prove there is some sort of greater power (which some calls God) from existent of Morality or Law of Human Nature.

Morality is not just a human convention because we often judge that on e civilizations's morality as better or worse. Thus, there is something we we judge it by. 
- The law of Human Nature or Morality

Morality is not just something that human decided it is right. It is from something outside of our self, higher than us.

C.S. Lewis make two facts or observations
1. Human all have this idea that they **ought** to act a certain way (Morality and justice)
2. They don't act that way

Importance is that you ought to, and not you desire to, or you feel like it

The Law of Human Nature or Morality is the thing that tells you, you ought to follow one of the two conflicting instincts that you have when you have to make a moral choice.

Instincts are the keys, the moral laws tells you what to play.

Moral law is most apparent when it tells us to side with the weaker impulse.

Instincts itself are morally neutral. Morality of instinct depend on their context or timing which is determined by the Moral Law.

Setting one of your instincts or impulses as a moral guide can cause catostrophic problems

The moral law is not just convention. because we can determine if a set of laws are better or worse. There has to be a standard that we are all using to make that claim.

We can only say that "my understanding of something is more correct" if there is something to measure against, something real.
    - my idea of New York is more correct than your idea of New York because it's real, there is facts about it

**The reality of the Law**
The law of Human Nature tells Human what they ought to do, not what they in fact do

This is odd. Given that other law tells us what things in fact do or are.

A behavior is not good or bad due to convenience to us.

Decent behaviour is not simply ones that are useful to us
The moral law tells us what we ought to do. And it is weird because where does it come from?
There must be something then that presses this Moral Law on us, if it is not man made
There could well be similar things going on with stones and trees, a power guiding what they should do
Something or somebody beyond this reality
Christianity, forgiveness and repentance have no power if there is nothing to forgive or reproof of. So you must start with the law

There is two major world views. There is a God v.s. there isn't a god

Within the branch of there is a god. There is still two major sub division. Monotheism and pantheism.

Pantheism, beyond good and evil

Monotheism
- problem of evil
    - but where did you get the ideal of evil from?
- Atheism is too simple

Reality is not simple, it is not something you woul have guessed
Christianity too, is not something you would have made up

Christianity says that this is a world that has gone bad
- the power of evil, created good but fell
- civil war in heaven
- we are in captured ground

Dualism - good v.s. evil
- both independent powers
- but how do you call one evil if there is nothing above them to judge who's evil and who is good?
- evil is spoiled good, it has to be derived from good. They can't be independent

### The Shocking Alternative

Is Satan presently being the Prince of this World, God's will?

You can will something to happen, but it doesn't have to happen. In fact you willing it allows it to not happen.

By giving man free will, it made made evil possible but it also made love and goodness possible

God thinks it is worth it to allow evil to happen, for the sake of allowing goodness to happen as well. We will just have to trust Him that it is worth it.

A creature with more capability, allows for more good, but also allows for more evil.

When there is a concept of self. There will come the notion to putting self in the centre, to be come like God. Sin of Satan, and the Fall -> "You will become like God"

God designed us to rely on Him for our happiness. There is just no other way to satisfy our desires.

God gave us hints about our human condition. He gave us conscience, the idea of good and wrong. He gave us the bible, of which we learned about the Jews-> and then Jesus who claimed that he was God, and he has power to forgive sins.

The fact that God can forgive sins means that all of our offences really primarily is an offence to God.

Jesus made claims about himself that if He wasn't God (who He claim to be), he would be a mad man. He can't just be a good teacher. Either God or a fool.

### The Perfect Penitent
If Jesus is God, then God has came in human form.

The main thing that Jesus came to do was to suffer and to be killed.

Christ's death has somehow put us right with God and given us a fresh start.

We don't need to know how it works, we just need to know that it works.
- C.S. Lewis states that if theory doesn't help you understand how it works you can drop it. Because the theory is only there to help you understand that it works. **I don't know if I agree with him**

It works very much like paying off a debt for a friend.

Repentance is a catch 22. You need to repent if you are a bad person. But it takes a good person to repent perfectly.

For a bad person to be able to repent, God needs to help him by giving a little bit of him self. In order to reason like God, and love like God.

God became men. In order to live a perfect life. This is necessary for God's plan to work. (pg 58)

Some object that Jesus' suffering and death isn't as valuable because He is also God, so its easier for Him. But that's what's precisely why He is able to do it.

### The Practical Conclusion

A new life, a new creature, has already happened.

We all belief something/facts because something else told us so. Whether a place exist or not, whether something happened or not. Because we believe that they are trustworthy/authoritative sources.

C.S. Lewis kind of talk about the new life as killing the old man, and putting on the new man.

The difference between someone trying to be good and a Christian is that the Christian believes that he can be good because God loves him, he thinks that all the good he has comes from God. The good man hopes to please God by doing good.

The roof is bright so the sun shine on it v.s. The sun shines on it so the roof is bright.

"Having Christ Live in You" doesn't just mean mentally or spiritually. It means that Christ actually operates in you. We can look at Baptism and communion, they are physical acts that shows that we are in Christ. It is very physical as well.
- you can also think of it as singing in worship. Our satisfaction in God is fulfilled also through our **doing**

Why didn't God come in with force to win back the world from Satan? To give people time to join His side.

## Book Three: Christian Behavior
### 1 The Three Parts of Morality

Many people think of God through the idea of Morality that He is a party pooper.

Morality is a set of rules that describe how a human should behave, should operate.

Be wary of the idea of Moral "Ideals" because it can suggest a personal, post-modern way of thinking about Morals and allows for some lack in the person trying to keep it. Think of it as Moral "Rules" and "Obedience".

No one can be a "perfect driver", but it is good and right that we try to be. Instead of allowing ourselves to break some rules some times.

Two ways of which the human machines goes wrong. 
1) Individuals colliding with one another
2) individuals themselves have conflict within themselves.

You can think of a fleet of ships going on a voyage. The ships have to not collide with each other and the individual ships have to be sea worthy. **You can not have one without the other.**

You can also think of a band, the individual instruments have to be tuned. And then each part needs to be played at the right time in cooperation.

We have not yet defined the purpose of the human machine. The destination of the journey. Or the piece the band is playing. 

Beside the two ways a human machine could go wrong, it is also important what the purpose of the human machine is. No point for the first two, if it doesn't serve its purpose.

However, many only thinks about the first point. Relationship between individual, or society. This is because people generally think they're doing okay if they're not causing other people harm, people will leave them alone if they don't cause other harm.

But good society depends on having good people. The individuals make up the community. Good law does not make good people. Good people make good society.

Now on to the third point. Our responsibility or purpose would be very different if we are made by something/someone and we are accountable to that thing/person. V.S. if we are only accountable to ourselves. 

1. The relation between man and man
2. Things inside each man
3. **The relation between man and the power that made him.**

Most would agree with the first point. And many differing opinions would come out from 2 and 3.

### The "Cardinal Virtues"

The last section C.S. Lewis have to explain the concept very briefly because it was a talk show on the radio.

There are 7 virtues. Four of them "Cardinal" and the rest are "Theological".
Cardinal being that all people recognize them. Theological meaning that only Christian would recognize them.

The four cardinal virtues are:
1. Prudence
2. Temperance
3. Justice
4. Fortitude (Guts)

#### 1. Prudence
Prudence is practical common sense. People need to know what they are doing and what will likely come out of it. They need to plan for the future.

We are called to be "harmless as doves" but "wise as serpents". Be like children at heart, but mature in wisdom and intelligence.

Christianity is a cognitive religion, you will need to exercise and hone your intellect in order to grow.

#### 2. Temperance
Referring to pleasures, not necessary abstaining, but knowing how far to take things.

It has been diluted with just "drinking too much" but the idea applies to anything. 

Someone can be too obsessed with golfing. And the external effect of it may be different from drinking. But God sees the heart.

Megalomaniac.

A common mistake people make when they go cold turkey on something is thinking that everyone else needs to do the same. This is very wrong.

#### 3. Justice
Does not just refer to the court room. But also include fairness, honesty, keeping promises, etc...

#### 4. Fortitude (Courage or Guts)
Means to stick to things under pain and facing danger. Endurance.

There is difference between doing something temperate or just vs being temperate or just.

A golf player can hit a good shot, but might not necessarily be a good player. A good player means that they have trained and practiced enough that they can be relied upon to make good shots.

It is the quality of the person that is considered virtue, not the actions. This is important because else it could encourage the wrong idea:
1. God is not concerned with the inner person but just the outward action/results.
    - It is important the why and the how of your actions
2. We might think that God simply wants people that obeys a set of rules, but he really wants people who have qualities just like Him
3. Heaven requires a certain sort of people to enjoy

### 3. Social Morality

Jesus never really preached anything new in term of morality. Do to other as you want to be treated is a summation of all the laws. And people all kind of know it already.

People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed. - Dr Johnson

Christianity does not set a detailed "political" programme for applying "Do as you would be done by" for any society at any time. It's a guide.

The NT does however gives a view of what a Christian society would look like.
- Those who don't work don't eat (no passenger, no parasites, no spectators)
- Obedience, to authority
    - children to parents
    - wives to husbands
    - setting up of leadership
- A cheerful soceity
    - singing and rejoicing
    - worry or anxiety as wrong
- NT hates "busy bodies"

Very interestingly, the ancient heathen greek (Aristotle), OT, and middle age Christian teachers all agree that we should not lend with interest. But the modern world runs on that (investment and loans)

Everyone should work so that they all have something to give. Charity, an essential part of Christian Morality.

But how much should we give? A safe rule is give more than we can spare.
- Our giving should cost us

Fear or insecurity stuns our giving

We could never get a Christian Society unless we have Christian individuals

### 4. Morality and Psycho-Analysis

To get a Christian Society where there isn't a lot of Christian individuals, we need to work on 2 things at the same time. 1) How does "Do as you would be done by" apply today? 2) How to become a Christian individual?

Christian Morality is putting the Human Machine right. Psycoanalysis does the same thing but done differently.

When given a moral choice there are two things happening. 1) The choice 2) the various feelings that comes with the option of choice (the raw material for the choices)

The raw material for the choices can be 1) natural, which is common among all people 2) unnatural, have to do with a broken subconscious 

Psychoanalysis works to remove the unnatural choices, Christian Moral works on making the right choice.

The unnatural feelings is not a sin, but a disease that has to be cured. God judges the moral choice.
- this aligns with the idea that being gay isn't a sin, but acting on it is a sin

God judges the moral choice. So for someone with a unnatural desire to do a good act, in God's eye it may be more pleasing to Him than someone who doesn't have that unnatural desire.

The more you are given, the more you will be judged by it. For those that have good upbringings and the likes, they should the more act with good moral judgement.

God judges the heart, and not the outward act alone. That's why man is called not to judge because we don't see the heart of man.

Many think that doing right is a bargaining with God. If I do good God will reward me. But really doing good is the act of transforming into a different being. You are changing who you are fundamentally based on the actions that you take.
Either more like God or more like Satan (who hates God)

When a men moves in the right direction he knows more and more of the evil within him. And like wise when he gets worse and worse, he understands less and less of the badness inside him.

You recognize your mistake not when you are making them when you are thinking properly.

### 5. Sexual Morality
Christian rule of "chastity" is different from the social rule of "modesty"

Modesty changes with time and culture.

The rule of chasity is the same for Christians at all times.

When someone break the rule of propriety in their own society, if for the purpose of lust then they are offending chasity. But if it is carelessness, then it is just bad manners.

Propriety changes, so try to do all the good you can to others and make other as comfortable as possible will be a good standard to cover all the bases with questions regarding decency.

Christian Chasity: "Either marriage, with complete faithfulness to your partner, or else total abstinence".

Our instinct is wrong.

The purpose of eating is to get nutrients. But most of our instinct for eating, our appetite is a bit more than what we need. Though there is a limit to it. But for sexual desires/instinct, the purpose is to product children, if we follow our instinct we will get way too much children.

Our sexual instinct/appetite has gone out of whack that we would stare at naked people.

The sexual appetite, like our other appetites grow by **indulgence**.

Perversion of the sexual appetite. Doing things that are not natural.

Christianity glorified marriage more than any other religion. Body and matter is good in the eyes of God. God took on flesh.

There is something very wrong with the state of sexual perversion when majority of the world's population are looking at erotic pictures and drooling over them

Before we are cured we must want to be cured.
It is hard:
1) Our wrapped nature. What we know about sex has been built on a half truth. Sex in of it self is good, but everything that has grown around it is not good.
2) People think Christian Chasity is impossible
    - but you have to give it your best for something that is required of you
    - Always keep trying. The process teaches you to trust in God, not on our own strength and never give up, and to not despair because forgiveness is always there.
    - The fatal thing is to sit contently with anything less than perfection
3) People think that it is to "repress" sex
    - but Christian Chasity actually make you recognize your sexual desire even more

Christian Morality is not about Chasity. Chasity is not the centre of Christian Morality.

Sin of the flesh vs Spiritual Sin
Animal self, and the Diabolical self
Diabolical self is the worse of the two (a hypocritical church goer may be worse than a prostitute).

### 6. Christian Marriage
Man and Women joined in one flesh. Not just a sentiment but a fact.

Not just a physical union, but a total union. Sex without marriage tries to take the physical union with all the other unions.
- Like eating with out the chowing, swallowing, digesting and pooping etc..

Marriage is for life. 

Justice includes keeping of promises. Divorce means that they broke their promises.

"Being in love" shouldn't be the whole of marriage. If the promise isn't part of the marriage, then what does it add? Just don't get married.

Funny thing is that those who are in love, loves to make promises and vows. The marriage vow is just a natural way for lovers to take seriously what their passion impels them to do.

A promise is a promise, not a feeling, but of an action. To stay together till death do us apart.

Marriage for when two people aren't inlove:
- for the children
- to protect the women

There is an another reason that have to do with best, better, and worse...
- it is better to be in love, but it is not the best thing
    - "being in love" does not last
- Love not just as a feeling, but of an duty/action is even better
    - this love keeps the promise
    - this love can last

Don't learn about love from movies, and popular medias
- marrying the right person doesn't mean you will always be "in love"

For many things, thrill comes at the beginning and do not last.
- the thrill will die away, and be replaced with a more quieter more lasting kind of "thrill"
- can give space for other "thirll"

Something wrong that we learn from movies: "falling in love" is something that happens to you

Two governance on marriage, one by the state, and one by the church governing its members

In marriage, the husband in the "head"
1) Why a "head"? -> Permanence
    - in the case that two party can not agree on something after long discussion 
    - the husband makes the decision and the whole marriage moves forward instead of separating
    - Ideally this should not happen, but it will
2) Why the husband?
    - the husband seems to be more just in dealing with things outside of the family
    - the wife is more likely to be concerned about protecting the family
    - The husband is there to handle the family patriotism of the wife from the rest of the world

### 7. Forgiveness

Most unpopular virtue?
"You shall love your neighbour as yourself" and you neighbour includes your enemies

Forgiveness is a nice ideal until you have someone to forgive

"Forgive our sin sins as we forgive those that sin against us"
- no one would invent a religion that asks us to do something that we ourselves so don't want to do

To forgive, start simple and then build up. Learn what loving your neighbor as youself means.

Loving your self does not mean, "the feeling of loving/liking yourself", "thinking that you are a good person", you are allowed to hate and loath the wrongs you have done, 

"Hate the sin and not the sinner", been doing it to myself...
- we can hate our sins, but we don't want to give up, we want to make ourselves better

Wishing, hoping the best for someone else

Though shalt not kill, two word greek word, kill and murder. All killing is not murder, as all sexual intercourse is not adultery. 
- We humans like to think in extremes when it comes to rules ("We can't even touch the fruit")

In war, we may kill and hate, but not enjoy killing and hating. In Christian Morals, attitude matters a lot.

To love someone even if they are unlovable. You love yourself also simply because it is yourself. It is the same way that God has loved us, not because we have any nice qualities.


### 8. The Great Sin
[[Pride|Pride]] or self-conceit vs Humility. The great distinction between Christian Moral and all other morals

This is the centre of the Christian Moral. The complete anti-God state of mind

Pride is competitive in nature. It is comparison that makes you proud. If there is no comparison there is nothing to become proud about.

Pride is different than all other vices (greed..) because it doesn't get satisfied (?). It will try to get more of something just because it wants to have more, better, etc.. than others

Pride's competitive nature makes it go on and on.

Pride makes everyone an enemy, an opponent.

As long as you are proud you can not agree with/know God. Proud looks down on everything.

Pride is very sneaky. It can sneak into our spiritual life. It can be used to make us look righteous.

Clarifications
- Pleasure in being praised is not pride.
    - the pleasure lies in not what you are, but you have pleased someone you wanted(and rightly wanted) to please
    - The danger lies in thinking "What a fine person I must be to have done it" than 'I have pleased him; all is well'

There are pride that is so bad that you look down on others so much that you don't care what other think about you. There are pride that wants to be praised that it is vain. Both are bad but we should not call in pride to cure our vanity.

3) Don't worry too much about being proud. Focus on knowing God and becoming more like him  and you will naturally become humbled.
4) Someone who is humble doesn't say that he is a 'nobody' when he is praised, instead he would be really interested in what you said to him.
    - a humbled person won't be thinking much about humility. In fact he won't be thinking about himself much at all

The first step to acquire humility is to realize that you are proud. There is a negative relationship between acknowledgement of one's own pride and one's humility.

### 9. Charity

The three theological virtues are Faith, Hope, and Charity
Forgiveness is a part of Charity

Charity doesn't simply mean "giving elms" but "love in the Christian sense" a state of will, not emotion. 
- charity is now associated with charity because it's the most obvious way to see charity

Liking or disliking something or someone is not a sin or a virtue, but what you do with it determines sin or virtue.

Liking someone can help us to be charitable to someone, but beware that it can also cause you to be uncharitable to someone else, or "spoiling" someone

Don't rely on feeling/emotion. Do the action and the emotion will follow.

Don't do charity expecting something in return.

The more charitable you are, the more people you will end up liking. The more un-charitable you are the more people you find you hate. (Self fulfilling prophecy)

Good and evil both increases at compounding interest. The small act you do can cause a big effect in the future.

Charity toward God. Don't rely on feelings, but do what one would do if they love God.

Our feelings may come and go, God's love for us never changes.

### 10. Hope
Christians are called to be hopeful.

Hope is looking forward to the next world.

Those who did the most in the present world are those are looked forward to the future the most.

Hope is not escapism or wishful thinking

The best things in this world can't satisfy us because we are actually longing for heaven.

1) Foolish way to deal with that desire -> blame the thing it self and look for another thing
2) The stoic way; delusioned "sensible man"
    - the whole thing is moonshine so do not expect much from the world
    - better than the first way but not the best
3) The Christian way
    - "Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists"
    - we are made for another world

### 11. Faith 
Faith on two levels.

1. Belief
    - accepting or regarding as true the doctrine of Christianity

Belief is a virtue, because humans are not rational beings. Even when things are logically, rationally proven to be true, we might still not believe it.

Holding on to things which your reason has accepted, in spite of your changing mood
Without this you would be like a boat tossed around in a storm. Changing your belief whatever your mood.

First step is accepting that your mood changes.
Daily remind yourself of key doctrines. (Devos, Church)
- Remind daily of what we believe

Most people simply drift away, and not due to reason.

Bad people never know badness because they gave in instead of fighting it.
Those that give in to temptation after 5 min will not know how strong the temptation is compared to someone who fought it for 10 hours...

We fail, we ourselves can never achieve a passing grade in God's eye.
And we can never add anything or do anything to God, because we do it through His strength and power.

### 12. Faith in the 2nd Sense

This 2nd sense of Faith would only make sense if one has already discovered faith in the first sense. Man's depravity.

God cares that we are of a creature of a certain quality. Not a creature that does a certain actions.

If man is rightly related to God, they will inherently also be rightly related to one another.

Really finding our our depravity vs repeating it parrot-fashion
- in one sense we will only learn it first hand if we try our hardest (in a sense it's a moral effort)
- in another sense, the trying leads to us realizing that our efforts are not enough, and we need God

One will not notice change when it is happening to him, only when looking back.

In one sense it is "throwing our hands up" and "leaving it to God" but you won't be doing it for the right reason unless you really tired to be good.

And even when you have fully trusted in Jesus it doesn't mean you stop trying. To trust in someone is to trust and do their advice. But you now obey in a different manner. Not to earn salvation but because He has already began salvation in you.

God offered everything for nothing.

Faith and Moral action are two blade of the scissors.

"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling" - seems like we do the work but then "For it is God who work-eth in you" - which looks like God does all the work.

Christianity may seems like it's all about faith, and doing good works. But really in heaven not one will be thinking about that except looking at the source of all good.

## Book Four: Beyond Personality: Or First Steps In The Doctrine of the Trinity

### 1. Making and Begetting

Experiencing/Knowing God first hand and Learning about God

- Seeing the Atlantic first hand vs looking at a map

- The Atlantic is more real
- The map, is a collective of people's experience.
    - the map shows you where to go to see the Atlantic ocean

- Theology is like the map
    - Doctrine itself is not God but it will help you get closer to Him
- You need to follow the map
- *Theology is Practical*

- Everyone is a theologian, it is just that many are bad theologians

Beget -> you create something that is like yourself
Make -> You make something that is different from yourself

God begets Jesus the Son of God, while God made man (similar but not the same)

Creation has some "symbol" of God but not God

When we move to men, the highest life form God made, we see the most resemblance of God in man. Except they don't have spiritual life.

Bio and Zoe

Man becoming the Son of God -> Bio into Zoe, gaining Spiritual Life

### 2. The Three-Personal God

1D to 3D
3D shape is make out of multiple 2D shapes
and 2D shape is made out of many 1D lines and curves

On higher dimensions you don't lose the lower dimension

Human Dimension vs God Dimension
On God Dimension you would still find things you find in the human level (personality) but there will also be much more complicated things

God, 3 person but one being. Just like one cube but 6 squares

Theology as an experimental science
Studying of Rock, initiative is all on you
Studying of animal, initiative is partly on the animal
Studying of another person, divided initiative

Knowing God, God takes all the initiative.

Theology is not simple because it's fact, it's real. Made up religions are simple.

### 3. Time and Beyond Time

God can attend to all our prayers because He is beyond time. He is not constrained by time.

God has no history. While Christ is was a man in a period of time in Human history. He is always the same.

### 4. Good Infection
The Son exists because the Father exists. The Son doesn't exists after the Father exists.

They both begin existing at the same time.

The Bible describe it as Father and Son because it is the best way to describe their relationship. But it doesn't mean that the Son came after the Father.

The statement God is love -> implies that God can not just be 1 person, it at least has to be 2.

The Holy Spirit as the 'spirit' of the chemistry between the Father and Son? Like the spirit of a family, club, organization...?

> [!QUOTE] C.S. Lewis
> Every Christian is to become a little Christ. The whole purpose of becoming a Christian is simply nothing else. #quote


### 3. The Obstinate Toy Soldiers

To think about Christ becoming man, a baby even before that. Think about if you would become a slug or a crab...

The transformation of created being into a begotten being has already be done for us by Christ.

This part really reminded me of Philippians 2:1-11.

### 6. Two Notes

Why didn't God just begotten more than one Son of God instead of going through this long and painful process?

- It would have been easy except human decided to rebel because of free will. Without free will there can't be love.

- There is only one Begotten Son because God is God. He is already perfect, there can't be anything else.

God intended people to be different.
- Same organism but different organ
- Same body but different body part

### 7. Let's Pretend

Beauty and the beast -> the girl kisses the beasts as if he was a man, and he really turned into a man

A man who have to wear a mask that made him nicer than he is, after a while he took it off and he sees that his face has formed into the shape of the mask

The Lord's Prayer

"Our Father" -> we are pretending that we are Sons of God??
- but aren't we children of God? once the Holy Spirit enters us?

Good pretending that makes you what you are pretending to be.

"Fake it till you make it?"
Change comes from a change in identity.

Christians are "Christ Mirrors" that brings Christ to others

> There are lots of nice things you can do with sand: but do not try building a house on it.

We become more aware of who are are (what is inside, motives, desire) than just our actions.
God is the only one who can change our very being. God does the pretending in us...

### 8. Is Christianity Hard Or Easy?

The single task of Christianity is to become like Christ. Nothing else.

It is different from "morality" and "being good"

By trying to be good, you will eventually burn out. And the natural self will win. You will either give up, or be grumpy when you "try to be good".

Christ says "give me your all". Not just your time, your money. He wants you. It is harder and easier. Christ wants to kill the natural self and replace it with Himself.

The Christian way is both hard and easy. "Take up your cross". "My yoke is easy and y burden light".

Sometimes what it is easy is also the hardest, and what is hardest to do is also the easiest to do.

It's hard to study for a test, but then the test becomes easy. It's easy to not study, but the test will then be hard.

It's easy to not train for a race, but once the race comes it will be hard. 

It's hard to give your all to Christ, but then everything else becomes easier. It's easier than all the other options. Those tries to save their life loses it, those that loses their life gains it.

If I am a grass field and want to produce wheat, I need to be changed into a wheat field. So to good, I need to be changed to a "good person". A change is required for a change in the fruit that I produce.

Paint vs dye/stain. One sits on the surface, the others soaks deep within.

There are many different parts of a church, but simply the church exists to draw men into Christ. 

### 9. Counting the Cost

God will not leave you at less than perfect. He will work in you until you are perfect. 

"Be holy for I am holy"

If you ask God to help you with one sin, He won't stop their. He wants to give you the full treatment.

God is pleased with your attempt, even though it is not perfect. "God is easy to please, but hard to satisfy. - George MacDonald

Don't let the current imperfection discourage you, God will pick you up and help you. But do know that God's goal is to bring you into absolute perfection.

Do not be complacent once you have gotten rid of one or two sins. 

We may not want to be made into a "saint", and we may say it in humility. But it's not about what we intend to be but what God intend us to be. 

When we are a fetus, if we have consciousness we might think that we are content being as we are. But now that we are more than a fetus but a human being, we would think other wise. Likewise with the change that God wants in us. We might not want it now, but we would be fools if we knew.

God moves in to our lives, and he is changing everything. He is making your shack into a palace.

### 10. Nice People or New Men

If Christianity should cause change in people to become better/good. Then shouldn't all Christians be better people than non-christians?

Conversion should cause positive change. You know a tree by its fruits. Results are better indicators than feelings.

The world isn't nicely divided into two parts of Christian and non-Christians. People individually are on a spectrum. Some are becoming more Christian, some are becoming less. Some are clegy men etc...

We should compare what a person is like before and after. Or what they will be like if they have not been a Christian. That will give whether or not Christianity claims to be what it is. Different people have a different starting point. But if given the time, there should be improvement.

Moreover, niceness/goodness/morality isn't the concern with Christianity but salvation. Will they offer themselves to God? 

Our goodness/niceness is not our own but God's gift. Paradoxically if we don't recognize that the goodness isn't ours. But once we realize that it is God's gift to us, and we offer it back to God. It becomes ours.

Being satisfied with being "good" or "rich" can cost your life. Other wise you would know that you need help. 

The Devil was an archangel once.

Mere improvement is not redemption

### 11. The New Men

Transformation

Into a new dimension

From creatures of God to sons of God

This development we can refuse. Not done through reproduction. Originated from Christ through "Good Infection". Can't be stoped. The creature would die if it stayed instead of being transformed.

To become holy is rather like joining a secret society. It must be great fun. (Those that are transformed can recognize each other)

To become like Christ, doesn't mean we will lose our individuality. Think of it like, Christ brings out the uniqueness in you. Just like how salt brings out the flavour of food (not the best illustration because you can overflower the flavor with too much salt, but you can't overpower a person's personality with too much Christ)

> It is when I turn to Christ, when I give myself up to His Personality, that I first begin to have a real personality of my own. #quote

Christ's the author of our life, He made us. He knows who we are meant to be. Without Him, we are slave to all other influences, and thus fail to become "truly ourselves".

To find it you have to not think about yourself. Don't go to Christ for the purpose of finding yourself. You will find it when you are trying to find Him.
