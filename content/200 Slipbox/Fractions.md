## Simplifying Fractions
Simplifying fractions means to reduce the fractions to a smaller number while keeping the same ratio between the numerator and denominator.

You do this by checking if the numerator and denominator can be divided evenly with a whole number.

$$
\frac{12}{10}=\frac{6}{5}
$$

## How to Multiply Fractions
To multiply fractions, multiply the numerator and denominator respectively.
Remember to simplify.

$$
\frac{3}{2}\times\frac{4}{5}=\frac{12}{10}=\frac{6}{5}
$$
## How to Divide Fractions
To divide fractions, multiply the [Reciprocal](../../Reciprocal.md) of the second fraction. Then follow the step to multiply fractions. Remember to Simplify

$$
\begin{align}
&=\frac{3}{4}\div\frac{2}{6} \\
&=\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{6}{2} \\
&=\frac{18}{8} \\
&=\frac{9}{4}
\end{align}
$$


## How to Add Fractions
To add fractions you want to make sure that the denominator of the fractions are common. 
- If common denominators
	- add the numerators and keep the denominator the same
- If not common 
	- multiply the numerator and denominator so that the denominator is common
	- then follow the step for common denominator

## Different Types of Fractions
- Type
	- Proper Fraction
		- numerator < denominator
	- Improper Fraction
		- denominator > numerator
	- Mixed Fraction
		-  whole number + proper fraction
		- When multiplying mixed fractions is best to convert to improper fractions
	- Unit Fraction
		- numerator = 1
- Group
	- Like Fraction
		- same denominator
	- Unlike Fraction
		- different denominator
	- Equivalent Fraction
		- fractions with the same value
