## Types of 3D Objects
3D Objects can be largely group into two groups.
They all start with a base, then the sides either converge to a point (pyramid) or the sides go up and then gets enclose by another "base" (prism)

### Pyramids
| Base          | Name    |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Triangle      | Pyramid |
| Quadrilateral |         |
| Circle        | Cone    |
- $v=\frac{1}{3}\text{area of base}\times\text{height}$
### Prisms
| Base | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| Triangle | Prism |
| Quadrilateral |  |
| Circle | Cylinder |
- $v=\text{area of base}\times\text{height}$
