I believe that when Jesus said you will have "treasures in heaven". Part of that treasure is people. People that you have touched on earth, and are now in heaven with you.

If you think about it. All the things, achievements, money you earned on earth won't last. You can't take them to heaven. But people will. Your relationship on earth actually last forever.

Therefore, it is extremely Christian to be people oriented and relationship oriented.
