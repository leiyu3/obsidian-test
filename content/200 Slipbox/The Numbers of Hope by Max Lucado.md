Birth, is a passive verb. Babies doesn't give birth to itself. The mother does all the work! So is the process of being reborn. ^cfb4ad

We are a stubborn people with hard hearts. But God still pursued us, and sometimes some of our hearts softens.

1.  Remember what God has done for you.
2.  Remember what you have done against God.

God [[Agape Love|agapes]] us.

Jesus is uniquely the One and Only Son of God. Jesus shares the same essence as God the Father. Christ claim Ultimate clout (pg. 46). The only way to God is Jesus.

Roman 3:10-11 shows us that there is a pandemic of heart disease.

Jesus takes our sins and gave us His righteousness.

The gospel is universal. Whoever, whenever, wherever. Believing Jesus seems to be the conditional of John 3:16.

God work and we trust.

Salvation is very simple, but we feel like it has to be complicated. The serpent pole with Moses, the Israelites simply have to look at the serpent. Naaman simply have to dip in the Jordan River to cure his leparsy.

We just need to trust Jesus.

We trust in things all the time. We sit on chairs, trusting that it will hold us. We drinking water, trusting that it will quench our thirst. We use light switches, trusting that it will turn on. ^b5356c

God don't want you to rely on yourself. He wants you to rely on Him. Salvation is only through Christ.

God protects His children. He sealed us with His Holy Spirit. We are equipped with spiritual armour. Jesus "buckles" you in.

Christ is the way. He doesn't just 'know' or 'show' the way, He is the way.

Hell is real and Hell is eternal.

Heaven won't be boring. We will be changed! We'll never be tired, never be bored, all sin are gone, we will be in our prime, we will be our best selves.

We'll have heavenly assignments.

Jesus is preparing a place for us.

Jesus offers "zoe" (quality of life) ^11973a

- Our lives are filled with "if only ..." expectations that failed to deliver.

And it goes round and round

- All this because we want to restore what Adam lost.

Jesus, the one who raised from the dead can give us life to the full.
