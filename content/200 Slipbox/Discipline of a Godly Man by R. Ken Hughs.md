title: Discipline of a Godly Man
---

### 1 Discipline for Godliness
- Train yourself for godliness because spiritual fitness have value not just this life but also for life eternal. (1 Timothy 4:7-10)
- Discipline denotes letting go of things that slows us down and of the sweatiness from doing hard work. (Hebrews 12:1; 1 Corinthians 9:25-27; 1 Timothy 4:10).
- Discipline is necessary to accomplish anything noteworthy in this life.
- In the current culture men are less likely to act like men while women are increasingly taking on the roles of man. (Cultural Feminism)
- Entertainments (games, porn, social media) are making men passive. It is making us imagine and fantasize instead of leading us to reflect and take action.
- Many are not disciplined because they are afraid that it would be legalistic.
- Discipline is not legalism, the difference is in the **motives**. 
- **Discipline is from love for God and wanting to please God**. Someone who is disciplined will say in his heart "I will do this thing because I love God and I want to please Him". 
- **Legalism is wanting to gain merit from God**. A legalist would say in his heart "I will do this thing to gain merit with God".
- Study shows that women are more spiritually inclined than men due to the male belief of self-sufficiency and individualism.
- Discipline is not restricting, it allows the GOATs to perform their crafts with great freedom.

### 2 Discipline of Purity
- God calls us to sexual purity (Leviticus 19:2; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8).
- Sexual immorality is extremely pervasive in the modern Christian Church today.
- The power of the Church has been greatly stunned due to complacency in sexual immorality.
- 2 Samuel 11, the story of David and Bathsheba, gives us an overview of how someone can fall to the sin of sexual immorality.
- Even great man of God can fall prey to sexual sin.
- We are desensitized by the culturally acceptable sensualities. Examples including indiscriminate TV watching or internet surfing, coarse humor, and dirty jokes.
- Temptation comes when we think we are the safest. We need to be on guard all the time. (Genesis 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8)
- When we are fixated on sin we forget God and God becomes less real to us in that moment, along with our identity, our holy calling, and the certain consequences of sin.
- We rationalize and make excuses for our sins.
- In the attempt to cover up our sins, we end up committing even more sin (Degeneration).

What can we do to grow in purity?

### 3 Discipline of Marriage
- Marriage is a shadow of the relationship between Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5)
- Husband have to love his wife "in sickness and in health... until death do us apart"
- [Robertson McQuilkin Resignation Announcement](https://mcquilkinlibrary.com/sermons/robertson-mcquilkin-resignation-announcement/)
- Marriage unites two person into one.\
#### Sacrificial Love
- Marriage is a chance to die to self, to love sacrificially as Christ have done. It is the same as following after Christ, forsaking your own desires seeking after Him. 
- Those who die to self are the most joyful.
- It is manly to die to self.
- It takes a strong man to die
- Sacrifice our time, our pleasure, our time
- Everything that we're called to do, Christ have already done.
- Christ not only suffered physically, he also suffered in identification with the Church. That is why when Paul is on his way to Damascus Christ said "Saul, Saul why are you persecuting **me**". Husbands in the same way will suffer by experiencing the pains, anxiety, worries, loss, of his wife. But he will also experience joy with his wife.
- In John 17, before Christ went to the cross he prayed for his disciples, and for all that would believe. After he died, and rose again, he continually made intercession for us.
- Husband have to make intercessions for his wife.

#### Sanctifying Love
- Marriage is sanctifying to both spouses. It gets rid of self-centeredness and self-will.
- Scripture's emphasis is on the husband's responsibility to sanctifying his wife. As Christ gave himself up to sanctify the Church (Ephesians 5:26-27)
- To love someone is to love them as a sinner.
- Seek your wife's sanctification
- It is a divine calling to seek the sanctification of one's wife. 
- Ask yourself these questions:
	- Is my wife more like Christ because of me?
	- Is she a better Christian because of our marriage?

#### Self-Love
- Love our wives as we love our own bodies &rarr; the 2nd great commandment (Ephesians 5:28-30)
- In three areas: physical, emotional, and social
	- Love our wives physically.
	- Understand our wives emotionally.
	- Understand our wives in many of their social settings. (Home, taking care of children, work, etc...)

#### How to Answer the Call?
- Commitment
	- "Put on Love" - Col. 3:14
	- Marriage is a covenant
	- Never back away from marriage
	- Your marriage should not be based on feelings
- Fidelity
	- A husband who loves like Christ did to the church will ever be faithful to his wife.
	- Our actions, thoughts, words needs to make our wives know that we will always be faithful to them.
	- *The Marriage Ring or the Mysteriousness and Duties of Marriage* by Jeremy Taylor
	- "for this is the marriage ring, it ties two hearts by an eternal band"
- Communication
	- We need to listen to our wife, and need to learn to communicate feelings and not just facts.
	- Learn to talk in similes and metaphors.
- Elevation
	- Build up our wives and show that she is valued. Compliment her.
- Deference
	- Sacrifice our plans for the sake of our wives
- Time/Romance
	- Take her on dates that are intentional.
		- Be creative, extravagant, pay special attention
	- One of the major factors in marital stability, happiness, and satisfaction is time spent together.
	- Don't rely on time spent together that just "happens"

### 4 Discipline of Fatherhood
- Children are gifts from God.
- Parents often take too much blame and too much credit for how their Children turns out. It is all the grace of God.
- As fathers, there is a profound love from your children, and this gives fathers a lot of power in how our children will turn out.

> [!QUOTE] Ephesians 6:4
> Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

Ephesians 6:4 can be broken down into Dos and Do nots
#### Fatherhood's "Do Nots"
Do not goad your children to resentment.

- Criticism
	- Children that were nagged with criticism loses heart. (Colossians 3:21)
	- Criticism comes with bad mouthing, tone of voice, back handed praise.
- Excessive Strictness
	- Handling a child is like handling a wet bar of soap. Too hard and it shoots out of your hand. Too soft and it slips out of your hand. A firm controlled grip keeps it in you hand.
	- Excessive strictness will teach your children to be a legalist.
	- Why are fathers so controlling?
		- How they were raised.
		- Confusing law vs grace
		- Over protective of their children from the world. And using rules as the clutch.
		- Fear of what other will think of them through their child.
	- Be generous with our "Yes" and save our "No" for the really important things.
	- Discuss topics with your children biblically and principally. Let them learn how to make their own decisions.
- Irritability
	- Never let a bad day affect your behavior toward your child.
- Inconsistency
	- Never, ever make a promise you do not keep.
	- Don't give mixed signals.
- Favoritism
	- No children should be favoured over others, but you shouldn't treat all children the same.

#### Fatherhood's "Do's"
##### Tenderness
- Bring up your children in love. Be kind towards them, and cherish them.
- Your children need to know that their parents are lovers outside of their relationship with them. 

> [!QUOTE] Christian Philosopher, Elton Trueblood
> \[A child\] needs also to know that his father and his mother are lovers, quite and apart from their relationship to him. It is the father's responsibility to make the child know that he is deeply in love with the child's mother. There is no good reason why all evidence of affection should be hidden or carried on in secret. A child who grows up with the realization that his parents are lovers has a wonderful basis of stability.
##### Discipline
- Training and punishment (Proverbs 22:6)

##### Instruction
- To place before the mind, to confront.
- Samuel's two sons were destroyed because he did not instruct them. (2 Samuel 3:11-13)
 - Along with all these we also need to be present in our children's lives. Be at the game, the play, the concert, graduation, etc...
- Our children's heart is turned towards us, and our hearts should be turned toward our children. (Luke 1:17)

### 5 Discipline of Friendship
- Gen. 1:28, speaks not of just marriage, but also that man is a relational being. We need friends, deep friendships.
- A man without deep friendships, robs his children, wife, and church of something greater.
- Christ's ministry revolved around his 12 disciples
- Mutuality of Soul
	- Friends shares the same worldview. They don't have to be the same on everything, sometimes quite the opposite.
- 1 Sam. 18:1, the friendship between David and Jonathan developed in a flash
- A friend wants to elevate his friend.

> [!Quote] Fyodor Dostoevsky
> To love a person means to see him as God intended him to be

> [!Quote] C.S. Lewis
>Friendship ... is the instrument by which God reveals to each the beauties of all others.

- Pray for opportunities to develop friendships
- Friendliness
	- Place ourselves in places that can develop friendships
	- Work at friendliness
	- Be consciously cheerful
	- Ask questions
- We have put effort in making friends
- Affirmation and word of encouragements makes you friends. (Proverb 17:17; 2 Corinthians 7:6-7)
- Work at being a good listener
- Be open and accepting


### 6 Discipline of Mind
- Our mind are special in that it can think God's thoughts. (1 Corinthians 2:16, Romans 12:2)
- It's tragic that Christians are not thinking Christian thoughts
- Secular drift and Religious anorexia (loss of appetite for growth in Christ) (Proverb 4:24; 23:7)
- Garbage In Garbage Out

> [!QUOTE] Philippians 4:8
> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.

- Phil. 4:8, speaks of taking in positive input. Which also implies rejecting negative input. What ever is not honorable, whatever is untrue, what ever is unjust, whatever is impure, whatever is not lovely.... do not think about these things.
- A Christian mind is constant on the look out to reject unchristian thoughts.
- What we are watching on T.V. really shows what our appetite is. Is our entertainment same as our unbelieving friends?
- The entertainment industry gives people what they want. It's a mirror to what the culture is like.
- Not watching T.V. (or any youtube, social media etc.) can be a very simple way for someone to become a more mature person and a better Christian.

- Philippians 4:8, Paul asks us to "think", which means to contemplate deeply.
	- Skimming through something v.s. intentional analytical viewing of something
- You can not be influenced profoundly by what you do not know. You need to be reading the scripture regularly.
- Though Scripture never demand that we read the bible once per year. We need to put effort in according to our ability.
- Renew your mind by rejecting the bad and inputting the good. Read the Word, immerse in it, marinate in it, bleed the bible. And supplement it by reading good literature, Christian and non christian. 
- Matthew 5:29, give a strong and harsh warning on sin and how we should deal with it. With Psalm 101:2-3, it tells us to be disciplined with our thought life.

> [!QUOTE] Matthew 5:29
> If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.

> [!QUOTE] Psalm 101:2-3
> I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.


### 7 Discipline of Devotion
- Time spent in prayer is like time exposure with God. Like a camera the more exposure time, the more an image in burnt onto the film. The more time we spent in prayer the more Christlike we become.
- Prayer bends our will to God's will 
- Martin Luther on a particularly busy day would wake up earlier and pray longer.
- Devotion life can not be broken down into simple rules. It is dynamic and organic.

#### Meditate
- Reading the bible regularly is a good start, but another step would be to meditate on it. To ponder and internalize. 
- 2 Tim 2:7: " Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything."

#### Listening
- "Ears you have dug for me" (Psalm 40:6)
- In our busy religious life, doing religious activities. We often forget to listen to God, to hear what he has to say. "Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required" (Psalm 40:6)
- Pray that we will really hear God's words. "He who has an ear, let him hear" (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22)

#### Muttering
- Psalm 1:2, on his law he "meditates" day and night
	- the word "meditates" used here means to mutter
- To meditate on God's word requires mind and mouth
- There are many passages that are good for meditation and murmur. The ten commandments, Matthew 6, the Lord's prayer, etc..
- Meditation can bring revival, wisdom, and growth in faith.

> [!QUOTE] Psalm 19:7
> The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;

> [!QUOTE] Psalm 119:97-98
> Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me.

> [!QUOTE] Romans 10:17
> So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

#### Confession
-  Spontaneous Confession
	- Confess our sins to God, whenever we feel convicted.
	- Psalm 139 talks about God's omniscience and omnipresent, ends with asking God to examine the psalmist's heart.
	- Isaiah too spontaneously confessed when faced with God, Isaiah 6:5
-  Systematic Confession
	- Romans 3:9-20, We should always confessed that we are sinners. As man who usually starts to become religious, we often forget.
	- We should confess specific sins. Write out specific sins and then pray it over.
	- By laying out your sin before God, it opens up the relationship to be more free. Friends that have no secret between each other have nothing to hide, nothing to fear.

> [!QUOTE] C.S. Lewis
> We must lay before him what is in us, not what ought to be within us.
> C.S. Lewis
#### Reverence
- We must have a real sense of reverence when we approach God.
- We must be fully engaged in our devotions, in our worship, in our prayers.

> [!QUOTE] Martin Luther
>To let your face blabber one thing while your heart dwells on another is just tempting God.... Any and everything, if it is to be well done, demands, the entire man, all his mind and faculties.

#### Contemplation
- Contemplate God through the world. Scripture often spoke of God's majesty, power, and wisdom in creation. (Psalm 19, 29, 139)
- Seeing God through His handiwork.
	- Macrocosm: something that is a miniature version of something much larger.
- Contemplating God through His attributes. A. W. Towzer's *The Knowledge of the Holy*
- Contemplate God through the story in the Scriptures. The transfiguration, the parting of the red seas, etc...

#### Worship
- It is appropriate for us during our devotions, meditations, and deep contemplations to break out into praise through prayer, songs, and speech to God.
- Psalms are full of these songs of worships. Along with many other songs found through out the bible. Moses' songs, Mary's magnificat
- Valley of Visions. Hymns, psalms, are all good resources for worship.

#### Submission
- Worship will lead to submission. To worship with our bodies, our lives, as a living sacrifice.
- Isaiah after his encounter with God. "Here I am! Send me" (Isa. 6:8)

> [!QUOTE] Thomas à Kempis
>As though wilt; what thou wilt; when thou wilt.

- The discipline of devotion can not be trained through principle and simple rules. But it will take discipline. We need to plan for it, put effort in it to become more like Christ.
- Prayer keeps us close to God. We need prayer because that is how we build our relationship with God. Christian faith is all about that relationship. When we sin we break it, when we listen and talk to God we build that relationship.

### 8 Discipline of Prayer
- Pray at all times. 
- John Bunyan refers to this as the "All Prayer"

> [!NOTE] Ephesians 6:18
> ... praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints ...

#### In Spirited Prayer
- How do you pray in the Spirit? 
- Roman 8:26-27
	- The indwelling Holy Spirit prays for us and joins us in our prayer.
	- The Spirit tells us what to pray for. Bending our will to God's will.
	- As the Spirit gives us conviction on what to pray for. He also gives us conviction that it is absolutely God's will. 
	- The fact God kept you praying for so long is evidence that God will answer your prayer.
	- Be open to the leading of the Spirit on what to pray for.
	- The Spirit empowers us to pray with confidence, even those that have been discouraged.

> [!Quote] John Bunyan
> Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the heart or soul to God, through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Holy Spirit, for such things as God hath promised, or according to his word, for the good of the church, with submission, in faith, to the will of God.

#### Continual Prayer (pg.129)
- Where in the bible does it calls us to pray continually?

> [!note] 1 Thessalonians 5:17
> pray without ceasing,

> [!note] Philippians 4:6
> do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanks giving let your requests be made known to God.


- Is it possible to pray continually?
    - No, in the sense that we can't be continually uttering prayers. We have other things that we have to do.
    - Yes, because it is about the attitude of the heart not about the action of prayer.
    - Yes, there are people in history that lived it out
        - Thomas Kelly *Testament of Devotion*
        - Brother Lawrence *The Practice of the Presence of God*
        - John Wesley

- One can live life doing things while having a deep underlying presence of God. A sense of continual connection / listening / reception to God.

#### Varied Prayer (pg. 131)
- Pray for all things. Pray for anything.

> [!note] 1 Timothy 2:1
> First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people

- Related to continual prayer, if we are praying at all times, then we will pray for all and any situation that pops up in our lives.

#### Persistent Prayer
- Moses lifted his hand while the Israel battled the Amaleks. While his hand is up Israel prevailed, if his hand is down the Amalekites prevailed. Then came Aaron and Hur who helped lift his hand. (Exodus 17:10-13)
- Parable of the Persistent widow (Luke 18:1-5)
	- The persistence of the widow make the unjust king answer her prayer
- At Gethsemane Jesus challenge his disciple to persevere in prayer thought the body is weak. (Mark 14:38)
- Ask...seek...knock, there is ascending intensity. (Matthew 7:7)

#### Intercessory Prayer (pg. 133)
- "for all the saints", Ephesians 6:18
- We are to prioritize prayer for the believers
- Paul often asks for believers to pray for him
- William Carey's mission was successful because his bedridden sister prayed for him for 50+ years.

#### The Practice of Petitionary Prayer
- The prayer list
	- A prayer list helps us to not get distracted to keep us on our toes on what to prayer for. We can even open our eyes and just read the list.
	- Prayer list can keep us on our toes on what is important for us, and keep our "I'll pray for you". 
	- Make multiple list if you want. As long as you have a list and going through them.
	- Start small. Relationships and stuff that matter to you. Index card, digital apps.
	
- Find some quiet time, and a place
- Try to give your best time to prayer. 
- The moment before you sleep are usually not an ideal time for your best prayers.
	- Learn from Jesus's example “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed” (Mark 1:35)
- The bible never prescribes prayer posture, but use what ever that increase reverence attitude. It's the heart that matters.
- Do what it takes so that you can be focused and in good condition to pray. Coffee, shower, shave etc....
- Prayer doesn't have to be long to be good. A short and passionate prayer is fine. Legalistic duration can kill consistent prayer.

> [!Quote] Martin Luther
>Look to it that you do not try to do all of it, do not try to do too much, lest your spirit grow weary. Besides, a good prayer mustn’t be too long. Do not draw it out. Prayer ought to be frequent and fervent.

#### The Discipline of Petitionary Prayer
- Prayer is work. We don't just do it when we feel like it, when we're good at it, when we have spare time. (Ephesian 6)
- Prayer is spiritual warfare.
- Pacing yourself when scheduling time for prayer or else you will burn out.
- Pray even when you don't feel like it or wants to. Battle over the one part of you that don't want to pray. And after a while you can bend that part of you to be co operative in praying. 

### 9 Discipline of Worship
- A tragic plague that is within the church is that man have flip the purpose of worship. Is it for man or for God? Is it for our entertainment? Or is it for magnifying God, glorifying him through proclamation of truth, and singing of praises?
- Should we be asking "What do you think of Sunday service today"? Or "What did God think of the service today and of those who worshiped?".
- Worship in "Spirit and truth" (John 4:24)
- By product of proper worship is that we will be satisfied.

#### Reasons for God-Centered Worship
- Divine Priority
	- God seeks worshipers. Worship is the greatest priority of a Christian.
	- Martha and Mary, worship is the greater portion. (Luke 10:41-42)
-  Divine Presence
	- God promised that he will be with us in a special way when we worship. (Rev. 1:20; 2:1)
	- Where two or three gather there will I be also (Matthew 18:20)

#### Doing God-Centered Worship
-  Preparation
	- Sunday morning can often be the most chaotic day of the week. Especially for couples with young children.
	- So Saturday preparation is very important.
	- Cloths laid out, breakfast decided, waking time set, departure time set, prayer about the Sunday Service, etc...
-  Expectancy
	- We must expect to meet God in a unique way. 
	- We can experience God in a more intense way when in a group of people, who are also worshiping. Than being alone.
-  In Truth
	- Our worship is fueled with what we believe about God.
	- So we need to be informed with Scripture.
-  In Spirit
	- Worship have to first come internally from a person. Instead of just external religiousness. 
#### The Discipline of Worship
- Worship is work
- Go to church early, pray, ready your heard.
- Do not let your mind wander. Sing meaningful. (1 Cor. 14:15)

> [!QUOTE] Augustine
> A Christian should be an alleluia from head to foot

- Beware of mindless babbeling. (Matthew 6:9-13)
- Silence during prayer is good. (Habakkuk 2:20)
- Be attentive during the reading of God's word. (Nehemiah 8:3,5)
- Instead of a habit of worship we need to have a heart of worship

### 10 Discipline of Integrity 
- We are fundamentally deceitful. (Romans 3:13)
	- Survey results shows that American have very bad morals. ***The Day America Told the Truth***
	- A survey by Rutgers University revealed that most high schoolers cheated in one form or another. University and college have lower percentage but not low enough.
	- Women behave with more integrity than man according to **The Day America Told the Truth**
	- And there is little difference between believers and non-believers. According to Doug Sherman and William Hendricks in their book *Keeping Your Ethical Edge Sharp*
	
#### God on Integrity
- The story of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts. Where they sold their property and gave part of the profit. But held back some for themselves, while stating that it was all that they had.
- Paul saw through their deception and Ananias died on the spot. Why is the punishment so severe? The church can not thrive in deception amongst its members. Deception is a sin against God. (Acts 5:4)
- This story shows that integrity matters a lot to God (Job 27:5)
#### The Shape of Integrity
- Psalm 15, blessed are those who have integrity
- People lie to cover up their mistakes, make things easier emotionally, to gain an advantage (Proverb 20:10, 11:1; 20:17)
- A man of integrity keeps his word, even when it hurts him. (Psalm 15:4)
- A man of integrity is hard to find (Proverb 20:6)
- Having integrity means to have principles and keeping your principles.

#### The Benefits of Integrity
-  Character
	- Integrity produces character, one's character defined their life on earth. 
	- Character glorifies God.
-  Conscience
	- A clear conscience, will make your life emotionally easier. When your heart does not condemn you but affirms you. (Proverb 10:9)

	- A transparent and honest soul/heart God desires. (Psalm 51:6)
-  Elevation
	- Integrity leads to more integrity, honesty to more honesty! A positive feed back loop! (Proverb 20:7)
-  Evangelism
	- Your integrity can be an evangelic magnet.

#### The Discipline of Integrity

- Make honesty a habit.
- Small things will surly leads to big things.
- Not doing something the first time, because repetition is so much easier.
- It is easy to tell a lie, but hard to tell only one.
- We become our habits. Make good one now because we are shaping our future through it.

> [!NOTE]
>Sow an act,
>  and you reap a habit
> Sow a habit
>   and you reap a character.
> Sow a character
>   and you reap a destiny for yourself
>   your family

### 11 Discipline of Tongue
#### Intrinsic Power
- The tongue though small, is powerful (James 3:3-6)
- Both Hitler and Winston Churchill used the power of the tongue
#### Destructive Power
- The tongue is like a small flame, that can set a whole forest on fire. The tongue has that kind of power in human relationship.
- The tongue's power is continual as it relates to hell. A place of continual fire. (James 3:6)
- The female spider does not have stomachs to digest food with. So it injects acids into its prey, and it turns their insides into hot soup.
- Words can be like those acids that not digest bodies, but souls. People's life have been sucked away through others words.
#### Verbal Cyanide

- What people would never say behind other's back (Proberb 29:5, Proverb 26:28, Psalm 12:3-4)
##### Diminishment (James 4:11)
- Related to gossip and criticism. People think that if it is true it is okay to say to a person even if what they're saying is damaging to the person. Or it is alright if you say it "face to face". Some may even think that it is their gifts to find faults and criticize.
- Most people are very aware of their faults and are trying their hardest to overcome them. It would be damaging if someone comes and assault them with what they already know and agree with.
- Diminishment also comes in the form of making one's virtue or accomplishment seem small. It can be done through body language, and side remarks.
	- This from of diminishment may be the cause of righteousness
	- Elevating self through putting down of others (Luke 18:11)

#### Worthless Religion
- Taming of the tongue is strongly linked to true religion. (James 1:26)

	- You want to do your best in the presence of the greats
- The lives of the Hall of Fame tells us that we can do it because they have done it.

#### Divest

- Sin: jealousy, lust, anger, pessimism, pride, erc..
- Hinder: not sin, but things that may be good for others but not helpful for us.

#### Run (2 Timothy 4:7)
- We all have a race set before us. All of our race is uniquely ours. No one run the same race, they're not equal. But each can finish their own race 
- Perseverance is patient fortitude. There's something beautiful about perseverance over something that is hard.
- Perseverance have nothing to do with giftedness, but to do with our heart. We may finish last but we can finish the race if we persevere.

- He perfected and founded our faith.
- We must deliberately life our eyes from things that distracts us to look at Jesus.
##### Focus on His Focus

- Consider how Jesus lived.

### 14 Discipline of Church
- Ecclesiastical hitchhikers.
	- “You go to the meetings, serve on the boards and committees, grapple with the issues, do the work of the church, and pay the bills—and I’ll come along for the ride. But if things do not suit me, I’ll criticize, complain, and probably bail out—my thumb is always out for a better ride.”
	- Or there are also people that pick and choose what church to go to. Go to one for preaching, send kid to another for their youth program, go to small group at another, etc.
	- "I attend" or "I go to" but not "I belong", "I am a member at"
- The reason in the recent churchless Christian:
	1. Too many emphasis on the invisible church, but not on the local expression
	2. Individualism, and emphasis on the personal relationship with Christ and no other authority

> [!QUOTE] Augustine
> The deserter of the Church cannot be in Christ, since he is not among Christ's members

> [!QUOTE] Martin Luther 
> Outside this Christian Church there is no salvation or forgiveness of sins, but everlasting death and damnation; even though there may be a magnificent appearance of holiness.

- The evidence of having God as your Father is having the church as your mother.

> [!QUOTE] John Calvin, subtitled chapter 1 of book 4 of his Institutes of the Christian Religion 
> the True Church with Which as Mother of All the Godly We Must Keep Unit

> [!QUOTE] John Calvin's commentary on Ephesians
> The Church is the common mother of all the godly, which bears, nourishes, and governs in the Lord both kings and commoners; and this is done by the ministry. Those who neglect or despise this order want to be wiser than Christ. Woe to their pride!

> [!QUOTE] Swiss Second Helvetic Confession
>For as there was no salvation outside Noah’s ark when the world perished in the flood; so we believe that there is no certain salvation outside Christ, who offers himself to be enjoyed by the elect in the church; and hence we teach that those who wish to live ought not to be separated from the true church of Christ.

#### The Doctrine of the Church
- 7 meetings that the Christian experiences in the church.
> [!QUOTE] Hebrews 12:22–24 (ESV)
> But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.

##### 1. The City of God
- Mount Zion was the center of the city of Jerusalem.
- When we come to church we come to the spiritual counterpart of Zion. The truest sense of the City of God.
- In a way the Kingdom of God has not come, but have already come. And we can experience it most clearly in the church (Phil. 3:20)
##### 2. Angels
- The angles join us in worship. Numerous angels. (Jude 14, Dan 7:10, Psalm 68:17, Heb. 1:14)
- The early church were extremely aware of the presence of angels.
##### 3. Firstborn Heirs
- "to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven."
- Jesus is the first born. We christians are *in him* therefore we receive all the inheritance with Christ, and are first born with Christ.
- When we go to church we are celebrating what Christ has done for us. (Romans 8:17)
##### 4. God
- "to God, the judge of all men"
- The bible tells us to come to God in fear and trembling. Because he is the all powerful, all knowing judge. But we do not have to come in dread because Christ have already taken away our condemnation.
- To come before God is our greatest delight. To be able to come before God. Especially with other Christians.

##### 5. The Church Triumphant
- "to the spirits of the righteous made perfect."
- We come together with the saints that have already lived their life on earth. And we consider and learn from them, on how they have lived.

##### 6. Jesus
- "To Jesus the mediator of a new covenant."
- When Jesus started communion. He would write the law on our hearts, and make us his people... (Jeremiah 31:31-34)
- The church is the new covenant community.
- The blessing of the new covenant is ministered through the church.

##### 7. The Sprinkled Blood (forgiveness)
- to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel (Gen. 4:9-10)
	- Abel's blood screams for justice and judgement
- Christ's word speaks of justice and judgement finally satisfied.  (John 19:30)
	- It is finished
- This is why we come to church. To celebrate what Christ has done for us. (2 Cor. 5:21). In giving us forgiveness of sin.
- The church is the biggest institution in the world. It is also the only institution that will outlive the world.
- To benefit fully from being part of Christ we have to commit to the church.
- You do not have to go to church to be a christian, you also don't have to go home to be married. But you're really just stealing yourself of the benefit of such commitment.

#### Benefits of Church
- Worship
- Feeding on the word
- Communion
- Vision and mission
- Discipline as you commit to the church
#### Discipline of the Church
1. Attendance
	- Sunday service, worship with the **whole** body of christ
2. Membership
	- Going under the discipline of the church, the pastor's care for you spiritual life, and serving the church.
3. Participation 
	- Church is not a spectator sport. We must participate however small our gift may be. Church is not just about what it can give you, but also how you can serve others.
4. Give
	- All are called to give, whether you are poor or rich.
	- "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Act 20:35)
5. Prayer
	- Pray for specifics!

> [!QUOTE] Timothy Dwight, heir to the Puritans and the greatest president of Yale University
>I love Thy Church, O God!
>  Her walls before Thee stand.
> Dear as the apple of Thine eye.
>   And graven on Thy hand
> For her my tears shall fall;
>   For her my prayers ascend;
> To her my cares and toils be giv'n,
>   Till toils and cares shall end.


### 15. Discipline of Leadership
- Joshua as the textbook of leadership, as the one who will succeed Moses.
#### Preparation for Leadership
##### Prayer
- Moses' prayer helped Joshua fight. (Exodus 17:8-9)
- **Leadership is not about one's skill or power, but one's ability to rely on God's power through prayer.**
##### Vision (of God)
- **A great vision of God is the defining mark of a great leader.** 
	- Joshua waited below as Moses went up further to receive the Law on Mount Sinai. Seeing God up close (Exodus 24)
	- Joshua met the commander of the army of the Lord (Joshua 5:13-15)
	- David's vision of God allowed him to challenge Goliath (1 Samuel 17:26)
	- Isaiah saw the Lord, "Here I am ! Send me" (Isaiah 6:1-8)
	- Peter, James, and John saw Jesus's transfiguration (Mark 9:2-8)
	- Paul, was not a part of the 12 apostle, but then because the missionary leader during the early church. (2 Corinthians 12:1-6)
- To grow your vision of God, read the Scripture, look at creation. They sing of God's glory. (Psalm 19)
##### Devotion
- **One's personal devotion/worship with God is of great important to be a leader.**
- Joshua though was not privileged to see God face to face. Would not leave. (Exodus 33)
- Mary of Bethlehem, sitting by Jesus's feet to hear what he has to say.  (Luke 10:42)
	- "She has chosen the good portion" 
- But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.  (Mark 14:6)
##### Magnanimity
- generous or forgiving (especially toward one's rival or less powerful person)
- Joshua was jealousy for Moses's leadership. But Moses's calmed him down. (Number 11)
- John 3:30 "He must increase, I must decrease"
- Luke 22:27, it's okay to be number 2,3,4,5. Jesus came to serve, and not to be served.

> [!Quote]
>True spiritual leadership knows nothing of a self promoting spirit. (pg. 241)

##### Faith
- Numbers 13-14
	- The Hebrew of Numbers 14:9 literally says, "Don not fear the people of the land, for our bread they are." (they are a piece of cake)
	- After scouting the land, the spies concluded that the land is indeed bountiful. But they were uncertain that they were able to conquer it. Except for Caleb and Joshua who said that it would be a piece of cake, all they have to do was move in.
	- But the majority disobeyed God and died in the wilderness before moving in the promised land.
	- Majority is not always right. In fact is often wrong.
	- God uses people who went against the flow.
Martin Luther, William Carey
(John Knox, John Fox, William Wilberforce, William Booth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer)

We live in a time where people think majority is right. And "everybody is doing it" is a rational for behaviours.

"grass hopper" complex

**Caleb and Joshua stood alone. They had great faith in their great God.**

Number 13:16
Moses changed Joshua's name
Hoshea ("salvation")
Joshua ("Jehovah is salvation")

##### The Spirit
Numbers 26:65

**Joshua is being inaugurated as the new leader of Isreal.**
**And the Holy Spirit was placed in him. (v18-19)**

A spiritual leader have to have the Holy Spirit and walking in the Spirit.
Acts 6:3,5

We need to be full of the Spirit. Or give off the aroma of Christ (Eph. 5:17-20)
- continually confess our sins
- walking in God's words
- Submit to God
- asking the Spirit to fill us

##### Expendability
[Deuteronomy 34](../../Deut%2034.md)

**Moses was the greater spiritual leader Israel had. But even still God didn't need Moses. Even Moses was expendable.**

**God does not need us, but he uses us none the less. We should take joy in the work, but not in ourselves.**

#### A Leader Needs:
- a vision, a dream
- able to communicate it
- delegate and orchestrate
- lead by demonstration
  > a single pice of string on a table
  > "Pull it and it follows, push it and it goes no where"
  > - Dwight D. Eisenhower

- Determination
  > Nothing in the world can
  >   take the place of persistence
>   Talent will not;
>     nothing is more common
>       than unsuccessful men with great talent.
>   Genius will not;
>     unrewarded genius is almost a proverb
>   Education will not;
>     the world is full of educated derelicts.
>   Persistence and determination are omnipotent.

> - Calvin Coolidge

### 16 Discipline of Giving
Many (or all?) Of the worlds most wealthy people ended up in a bad place Either penniless, or insane, or suicide.

Serious warning against the allure of money.

The cure that is repeated in the bible is "the grace of giving"

2 Corinthians 8

#### Grace Giving in Israel's History

##### The Lord's Tithe

10% this is the bare minimum. Everyone had to pay this or else they are robbing God.

Num 18:21-29
Lev 27:30
Malachi 3:8

##### The Festival Tithe
Deut. 12:10-11, 17-18

Another 10 percent, for celebration and building community

##### The Poor Tithe

Deut 14:28-29

For the poor 10% every 3 year.
3.3% every year

Lev. 19:9-10
Left over for the poor to glean
Neh. 10:32-33
Tax for buildings.

Min of 25% per year

##### Grace Giving
First fruit offering 
Num. 18:11-13

Israelite would give the best to God even before he harvested everything

Freewill Offerings
Ex. 25:1-2
Ex. 36:2-7

##### Grace Giving in the New Testament 

2 Cor 8:1-2
The Macedonians gave in their **extreme poverty** and **severe affliction**

The "american way" with credit card,
buying things you do not need with money you do not have to impress people you do not like.

Credulity: tendency to believe readily

Giving is viewed as a privilege. v3-4, they were begging to give.
Giving is not related to how well off you are. 
The grace of giving is related to the willingness to give.
The grace of giving is related to how much someone is willing to give oneself to God. (v5)

##### The Influence of Grace Giving
God can have our money but not our hearts but God can not have our hearts if He does not have our money. 
“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Matt. 6:21).

There's more warning about money than other kind of sins, many of which are from Jesus himself.

“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God” (Mark 10:25)

“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal” (Matt. 6:19–20)

“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money” (v. 24).

“Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (Luke 12:15)

Parable of the man who build a bigger barn but then dies that very night.
“So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God” (v. 21).

Wealth as a spiritual handicap

“With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God” (v. 27).


Grace giving gives to where it hurts. Where one has to change his lifestyle.

>If our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc., is up to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too little. If our charities do not at all pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought to be things we should like to do and cannot do because our charitable expenditure excludes them.
>- C.S. Lewis

Christ never asks us to do anything that he didn't do himself.
“For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich” (2 Cor. 8:9)

#### The Discipline of Giving
##### Mental Discipline
1. Giving is not a meritorious work. It will not make you look better before God. Or be better than other Christians.
2. Giving will not bring favor from God but blessings.
  - “Give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you” (Luke 6:38)
  - “The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully” (2 Cor. 9:6)
  - **Spiritual Blessings**
3. Giving that pleases God is generous and sacrificial.
  - “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box” (Mark 12:43)
4. What you give is to be determined between you and God. Takes serious thought.

##### Volitional Discipline
1. The act of giving should begin with giving of oneself.
  - As the Macedonians did (2 Cor. 8:5)
  - An act of worship Rom 12:1
2. 10% is the bare minimum
3. Giving must be regular
4. You must give now.
  >A preacher came to see a farmer and asked him,
  “If you had $200, would you give $100 of it to the Lord?”
  “I would.”
  “If you had two cows, would you give one of them to the Lord?”
  “Sure.”
  “If you had two pigs, would you give one of them to the Lord?”
  The farmer said, “Now that isn’t fair! You know I have two pigs.”
5. Giving should be joyous.
  - "For God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:7)

“It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35)


### 17 Discipline of Witness
- Seeing someone comes to Christ. Especially those you know personally, gives you unspeakable joy!
- Just ordinary day to day "average" wittnessing

- We take a look at Andrew, an example to us on how to witness for Christ
- Andrew before he met Jesus he was already following John the baptist. 
  - He was spiritually sensitive
- He was the first one called. *Protokletos* which means "First-called"
  - And he was the one who brought Peter his brother to Christ
- But Andrew was not part of the inner 3, didn't write any epistle, was not as prominent amongst the apostles.
- **But Andrew excelled in bringing others to Christ!** 
- Average guys who loves to bring others to Christ

#### Average Andrew's Extraordinary Heart
##### A Knowledgeable Heart
Andrew's knowledge of Christ made him want to tell everyone about him
  John 1:35, 39-40
The immediate and personal you know Christ, the more you would want to share Him with others.

##### A Magnetized Heart
Andrew was so drawn to Christ that he believed that if one would just be exposed to Christ, they would be drawn aswell.
If we want to draw others to Christ, we too have to be drawn to Christ as Andrew is.

##### A Selfless Heart
Andrew in the gospel accounts was constantly refered to as "Simon Peter's Brother"
Matthew 10:2-4, Luke 6:14-16
John 6:8, John 1:40-42

Andrew introduced Peter to Christ, even though he knew he would fade into the background.

##### An Optimistic Heart
Andrew is optimistic when it comes to problems when presented to Christ.

When they were trying to feed the five thousands, Philip was unconfident that they would be able to do so. But Andrew was optimistic and showed the 5 loafs and two fishes (John 6:5-9).

Our attitudes affect how we share Christ, and how others would receive Christ.

>Expect great things from God, attempt great things for God.
>- William Carey

##### An Expansive Heart
John 12:20-22,
when the Greeks wanted to see Jesus
Philip wasn't sure what to do, so he went to Andrew
Andrew knew that Jesus is for everyone, so he went straight to Jesus

We need to expand our heart. That Christ accepts everyone.

##### Extraordinary Encouragement
Andrew was just an average guy. No education, no charismatic personality. But the Christian world was shaped by him as much as the other guys.

Billy Graham called his crusades "Operation Andrew"

#### Ordinary Andrew Evangelism
- 75-90 % came to church through the influence of family and friends

Ordinary everyday evangelism is the most effective
100% of christians can do relational evangelism

- [ ] Memorize Matthew 28:18-20

#### Discipline of Witness
##### The Value of Relationships
God has ordered everything in our lives. That includes all the people that we meet. They are not just accidents.

Humans are immortal beings. How we have interacted with them and influenced them have eternal consequences.

##### Identifying Relationships
- There are different spheres of relationships in our life:
  - Biological (family)
    - By extension church
  - Geographical; Where we live
  - Vocational; where we work
  - Recreational; where we play
- Make a list and begin to pray for them

##### Investing in Relationships
- invest time with those who you want to reach
- invite out for lunch or dinner, etc..
- do things to gether
- birthdays, graduation, holidays, weddings, birth.
- Visit, call, write a note

This chapter feels like it ended abrutptly. Usually there would be more stuff.

### 18 Discipline of Ministry

Small heart, wearing blinders so as to not see the sorrow of life.

Enlarge your heart, live with ideals. Be open to sorrows in life.

>In the shape of converts I have seen no results. I have not, as far as I am aware seen anyone who even wanted to be a Christian
>James Gilmour, pioneer missionary to Mongolia


> Several huts in sight. When shall I be able to speak to the people? O Lord, suggest by the Spirit how I should come among them, and in preparing myself to teach the life and love of Christ Jesus.
> - James Gilmour

James Gilmour would not be sad for the Mongolias if he didn't care. 

Ministry is linked with pain.

But small hearts never does anything for anything even though it might be nice to be safe and protected.

But an enlarged heart changes lies, and leaves "heart-print" on the world.

Never play baseball and you will never strike out, but you will also never strike a home run.

Never climb a mountain and you will never get hurt but you will also never be on top of a mountain.

#### Disciplined to Labor
- Jesus rest as the well in Samaria. 
  - The bible describes that Jesus was exhausted
Even still Jesus ministered to the on women who came to the well.
"The world is run by tired men"
The world is evangelized by tired missionaries.

Wilfully Inconvenienced

D. L. Moody

#### Disciplined to Reach Out
Jesus reached out to the Samaritan Woman. Passing the gender barrier of that time as well as the racial and religious barrier. Futher more the women has had 5(?) husbands

We should do this not in a "do gooder" manner but with biblical Egalitarianism. As sinners to sinners, equal to equal.

#### Disciplined in Perspective
Jesus knew he had to go through Samaria. He could have went around it but He knew this is what God had planned.

There are no relational accidents.

>The steps of a man are established by the Lord
>Psalm 37:23 NASB

### 19 Grace of Discipline
- "Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness" (1 Timothy 4:7 NASB)
#### How should we respond?
- Avoid paralysis of analysis when we see so many different aspect of a disciplined life.
- Avoid legalism as well.
- Avoid reductionism
- Avoid seeing this book as a checklist.
	- Christianity is more than a checklist
- Avoid "5 pages a day, puts the bible away"
- Christianity is a relationship with Christ. 
	- Requires disciplined maintenance, but never legalistic reductionism
- Avoid self-righteous legalism
	- Legalism: I will do this thing to gain merit with God
	    - Man centered
	- Discipline: I will do this because I love God and wants to please him.
	    - God centered

#### Wisdom for Discipline
##### Prioritize
- Look through the different disciplines and list off what you are doing well on and what you need to work on, then look at the action steps and choose 1-3 things that would help you the most.
- Focus on a few, better to do well on a few than to fail through overcommitment
##### Be Realistic
- Be realistic, challenge yourself but be real with yourself.
##### Pray
- Give your self a week to pray over them and think about them.
- Seek the HS for other disciplines not listed here

##### Be Accountable
- Ask spouse or friend to hold you accountable for your disciplines.

##### If You Stumble...
- Don't quite
- Failure is part of succeeding
- We are under grace

##### Grace of Discipline
- The Christian life begins with Grace alone and continues with Grace alone.
- James 4:6 "and He gives more grace"
- John 1:16 "grace upon grace"
- "But by the grace of God I am what I am" (1 Corinthians 15:10)
