## For a Group
- I think last time I did 8 cups for 8 people? -> we end up with I think 1-2 cups of left over rice
	- 3 left over avacado (i used one big bag of avacados)
	- and maybe half a package of imitation crab meet
	- 10 kirkland (sm) hotdog was not enough
-  For bigger groups would need to split into groups
	- for a group of 8, 3 sushi mats would be good
	- We could include mini games/tasks
		- to keep cleanliness of sushi making
		- to make sure people are making it right
		- to make sure they aren't wasting food
		- Ideas
			- Rice to Filling ratio
			- Biggest roll (diameter)
			- Maybe spiciest sauce/judges favorite sauce/favorite filling combo
			- Hybrid sushi (most amount of different fillings)
			- Inside Out Roll (have picture, need to be well made)
			- HandRoll
			- Rice Ball
			- Most amount of sushi made (need to fit a criterial(minimum size) to be counted)
			- Make California Roll, etc...
			- Take picture with whole team
			- Wasabi Challenge (eating with the most wasabi)
