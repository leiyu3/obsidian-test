- The Five Number Summary
	- Min
	- 25% (First Quartile, lower)
		- the median of the min and median value
	- Median (Q2)
		- For an even set of data, median is the average of the middle 2 number
	- 75% (Third Quartile, upper))
		- the median of the median and max value
	- Max
- Interquartile range: upper - lower

## Example
For a data set of: $$19, 21, 23, 20, 23, 27, 25, 24, 31$$

Ordering the dataset: 
$$19, 20, 21, 23, 23, 24, 25, 27, 31$$
n = 9
Median is the 5th number: 23
Q1: $\frac{20+21}{2}=20.5$
- calculated without the median and anything above it
Q3: $\frac{25+27}{2}=26$
- calculated without the median and anything below it

IQR: $26-20.5=5.5$
