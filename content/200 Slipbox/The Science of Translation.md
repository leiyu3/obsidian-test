## Problem of Text
When translating we want to have the most original writing as possible. Problem is, we don't have the original writing any more. We have thousands of copies.

The OT, there are the Aramic language and [[../../Septuagint|The Septuagint]].

Most the New Testament writings/copies are from the dead sea scrolls.

Quality of the "manuscripts".
- We want it to be as close to the time of the original writing

### Textual Criticism
- Sifting through the thousands of copies to figure out the correct wordings
- Common copyist mistakes
	- 'then' with 'than'
	- 'their', 'there'
	- [skipping a word, "not"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_Bible)
	- 'the Judas bible'
- When there are multiple "good" translations, a good translation will have footnotes indicating that

## Problem of Language
- Original Language
- Receptor Language
- Historical Distance

### Philosophy of Translation
Chooses how much we want to close the Historical Distance between Original and Receptor Language.
- Free (Paraphrase)
	- "Always?" done by one translator
	- The MSG
- Literal
	- NASB
	- KJV
- Dynamic Equivalence
	- ESV
	- NIV

### How Translator deal with Historical Distance
1. Money, weight, measurement
	- Use original word, but keep the reader guessing and bridge the gap themselves?
	- Use modern equivalent?
	- For money, what about inflation?
2. Euphemism (Sex and Toilet)
	1. Translate literally and let the reader bewildered or guessing
	2. Translate literal equivalent, but perhaps offend or shock the reader
	3. translate with equivalent euphemism (Best)
3. Vocabulary
4. Grammar and Syntax

## On Choosing a Translation
1. The best for daily reading, and primary usage is Dynamic Equivalence
2. Second is Literal
3. Free, is help for thinking about possible meaning of a text
