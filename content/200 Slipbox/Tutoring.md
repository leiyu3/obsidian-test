## Tutoring Experience
First year tutored at EPIK with TCM, where I tutored elementary school math and english.
Then for 2 years tutored high school Math and Physics at Tutor Doctor.
Then went into private tutoring for the last 2 year.
And have tutored over a dozen students.

## What is My Set Up?

I use an iPad and MacBook.

Google Meet, would prefer Zoom but it has a 40min limit per meeting, so Google Meet is better for free users.

How ever to share screen from iPad on Google Meet I need to pay for Reflector 4.
This allows Goodnotes to use its built in screen share feature over to Google Meet.

- iPad, Goodnotes
- Reflector

### Experimenting with Obsidian Excalidraw
Very excited to try use Excalidraw as a white board for tutoring. It has an infinite canvas, stores everything locally. Only concern is the drawing ability as well as the performance.
