I started learning Japanese around the Fall of 2022.
The main motive being that I hope to share the gospel to the Japanese in their own language.
It will be a long way before I can do that, but I am enjoying the process and it is really rewarding when I look back and see the progress I have made.
In this article, I want to share my journey so far and the various things I did to learn Japanese.

### Learning Hiragana(ひらがな) and Katakana(カタカナ)
The first step I took was to learn how to read Hiragana and Katakana. 
These are two of the three scripts used in Japanese.
The third being Kanji.
I find Tofugu's [Hiragana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) and [Katakana guide](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/) to be very useful.
I did their [Kana Quiz](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/) and their Kana Reading practice sheets.
At the same time I made [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)[^anki] decks to memorize the Kanas.
It took about two weeks for me to get a good handle on the kanas.

### Genki 1 Textbook
I then moved on to Genki 1.
It is a popular Japanese textbook that teaches N5[^jlpt] level vocabs, grammar, and kanjis. 
It is written to be used in a class room as there are questions that requires you to have a conversation with a partner.
Since I was going through the book alone, I just skipped those questions.
It also have listening exercises, which I find to be very helpful.
I was also using Anki to memorize the vocabs from each lesson.
I work through the textbook for about thirty min a day, five days a week.
And I finished the whole book in about six months.

### Immersion
While I was going through Genki 1. 
I came across [Steve Kaufmann's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCez-2shYlHQY3LfILBuDYqQ) on language learning.
He advocates a lot on making language learning fun and enjoyable.
That the best way to learn a language is the way that keeps you engaged and keeps you coming back.
Letting the language sink into you than forcing the language in.

I really resonated with that and I started to lean more into language learning through immersion.
And so, I decided to learn through various ways of immersion. 
Below are a list of things I did for immersion after finishing Genki 1:

- Reading manga in Japanese. (Yotsubato!)
- Reading news articles in Japanese. ([NHK News Easy](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/))
- Watching anime with Japanese subtitles. (Nichijou)
- Listening to podcasts made for Japanese learners. (Nihongo Con Teppei)
- I still use Anki but this time with the [Core 2K Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2141233552)
- Listening to Japanese songs and learning the lyrics

### Current Level and Future Goals
I am currently around N4 level at the writing of this article.
And I hope to pass the JLPT N3 this December, 2023.
Maybe I will start doing more focused study to pass N3.
I am really just using the JLPT as a progress marker.
Whether I pass it this December or not, as long as I am continually engaging with the language, I will continue to become better and better.

I do want to challenge readers to pick up something they have always wanted to try.
And just try to enjoy the process even though you may be terrible at it in the begining.
If you keep at it you will get better.
