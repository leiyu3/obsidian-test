My first time running the Toronto Waterfront Half Marathon, but my second marathon of the year.
It is a much bigger event compared to the Georgina Marathon, and I was not disappointed, a huge crowed, and much more lively.

### Pre-race

Woke up early, and had probably about only 6 hours of sleep. Ate a banana, a hard boiled egg.

Still had injuries from the Georgina Half Marathon from last month, with exterior tendonitus on my left foot and injury on my left knee.  
Still planned to run a 6:30/km paced race, just a little bit faster than my last half marathon.

### Race

The first 19km was pretty good and went as planned, sticking close to 6:30/km pace. Around the 19km mark, both of my thighs cramped, I searched the muscle after the race, and it was both of my vastus medialis muscles that cramped up. And as seen in my splits my pace grately reduced. If I hadn't cramped, or recovered properly I probably would have beatened my PR, and probably would have ran a negative split at the end. But unfortunately I had to end very weak. But a great experience none the less.
