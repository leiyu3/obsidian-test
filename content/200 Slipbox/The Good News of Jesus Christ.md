The Gospel, is derived from the Greek word 'Ευαγγέλιο' (pronounced euangelion).
Which means "Good News".
To understand the Gospel is to understand who Jesus is, what He has done, and what He promised to do.
And to do that you would also need to understand what Sin is.

### The Problem of Sin
What is Sin?
Sin is anything that is against the will of God, anything that falls short of His standards.
Whether actions, word, or thoughts.
We can all think of things that we have done wrong and feel guilty about.
If we have failed even our own standard, then how much with God's standard?
If we have told a lie, hated someone (Matthew 5:21-22), stolen something, look at another with lust (Matthew 5:27-30), placed anything in our heart above God (Exodus 20:2-17), then we have failed God's standards.

Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned and all have fallen short of the standard that God has for us.
No one is righteous before God and all will face the consequences of their sin (Romans 3:10).

What then is the consequence of Sin?
The consequence of Sin is separation from God (Isaiah 59:2) and death (Romans 6:23).
God as a just judge will bring justice on our sins.
If God's wrath is upon us.
How can we escape from the wrath to come?
If we continue reading Romans 6:23, it contains the solution.


### The Gift of Jesus Christ

> For the wages of sin is death, *but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord.*  
> -- Romans 6:23

So what can a sinner do before a holy and just God?
We can not save ourself on our own, we have already failed.
This is why Christ came to earth, as both God and Man.
To live a perfect life, He was sinless and have done no wrong.
He died on the cross for our sins, paying the price that was ours to pay (1 Peter 3:18; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
And resurrected on the third day, signifying His victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Luke 24:46-47).
Thus, he satisfied God’s wrath and defeated the power of sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).
Moreover, he imputed his righteousness on us so that now our standing before God is righteous.
When God sees us, He no longer sees our sins but Christ's righteousness.
Therefore, God’s justice and love was satisfied on the cross.
We are saved by grace alone through Jesus’ death.
God showed His love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).


### How to Receive this Gift?
Now, if we understand our need of a saviour, and what Christ has done for us.
How do we receive God's free gift of salvation?

Romans 10:9-10 says *"if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."*

John 3:16 says that "whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life".

And Acts 3:18 says "Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out."

Believe in the person of Christ, who He is, what He has done, what He promised, confess Him as your Lord and repent from your sins.
There is no other way to God except through Christ alone (John 14:6).
Ponder and think.
If these are really true, then there is real danger to waiting around.
But if the gift of Christ is also true, then there is joy everlasting waiting for you.
Will you put your trust in Jesus Christ alone, leaving your sins behind and follow Him?

### Result of Receiving this Gift

By receiving this free gift, you will have peace with God (Romans 5:1-2).
Christ's death has paid for your sin, you will no longer be enemies of God.
Instead you are now free from the death penalty of sin, and you have been adopted into God's family (John 1:12).
And you may experience life to the full (John 10:10b).
There is many many more blessings, but I would recommend you to read the Bible for yourself and learn all that there is in Christ.
A good place to start would be the book of the Gospel of John.
