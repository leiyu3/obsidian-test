The Bible is at the same time **both** human and divine ([[Jesus|Jesus?]])

* Bible as God's Word
    * it has eternal relevance
    * written in human words in history
        * have historical particularity
* If you only think of the Bible as a human book
    * you will only be interested in the religious ideas, of the jews, muslims, or the early church
    * the task will only be a historical one
* If you only think of the Bible in term of it's eternal relevance
    * you will only read the bible as rules to believe and obeyed

## What that means for Interpreting Scripture
1. the Bible was first written to the people at that time 
   * the challenge is that we are so far removed from the culture and language of that time
   * to first understand how the bible apply to us, [[./Exegesis|we first need to know what it meant to the original hearers]]
2. God chose to use [[./Genres of the Bible|different genre of literature]] to speak to us, therefore we need to know how to read the different genre of texts
