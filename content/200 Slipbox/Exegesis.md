## What is Exegesis?
The careful study of scripture to get to the original intent of the words of the Bible.

We do exegesis when we say: "What Jesus meant by that was...", "Back in those days, they used to...". The Problem is that our exegesis is often bad, they're too selective. Not from primary sources.

Selective exegesis is when we bring our own biases into the text. Which makes God's word say something other than what God actually said.

Getting help is not required, but when one does get help from commentaries, they should pick good ones.

> [!example]- Example from Mark 10;23
> "How hard is it for the rich to enter the kingdom of God. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom"
> * one source said that there was a gate in Jerusalem known as the "Needle's Eye", which camel can only go through by kneeling.
>	* Implying that a camel can go through the gate but with much difficulty
>	* However this is wrong
>* It is impossible for a camel to go through a needle's eye
>* It is impossible for someone who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God. It will take a miracle.


### At the highest level, exegesis requires:
- one to know the language and the culture surrounding the original text.
	- Jewish, Semitic, and Hellenistic. 
- Figuring out the original text when the manuscripts have variant readings
- use of primary sources and tools.
	- What are "primary sources and tools"?

### However, you can learn to do good exegesis without all those knowledge
- develop and learn with the skills you currently have
- using the work of others

- Key to GOOD EXEGESIS:
	1. Reading the Text Carefully
	2. Asking the Right Questions

The Basic question to ask every passage:
- How would the original audience of this text understand it? (Context)
	- Historical
	- Literary
- What does the text say? (Content)

We do this by understanding the historical context, and textual context.

## The Historical Context
### What?
* **time** and **culture** of the author and his reader
    * the **geographical**, topographical, and **political factors**
    * the **occasion** of the book, letter, psalm, prophetic oracle, or other genre
    * example:
        * the personal background of prophets _after_ the exile
        * the expectance of the Messiah during the time of John the Baptist
        * penny is actually a day's wages
        * understanding mountain the way that the middle east understands it
	        * What is it?

### How?
* often require outside help
    * good bible dictionary
        * the four-volume _International Standard Bible Encyclopedia_
        * five-volume _Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible_
        * one-volume _New Bible Dictionary_
* _occasion_ and _purpose of each book or parts
    * often can be found within the book itself
    * from good commentaries
    * _Eerdman's Handbook to the Bible_


> [!EXAMPLE] Symbols of Elephant and Donkey
> If we say "The Elephant Stomps over the Donkey" around November the US presidential Election
> We will understand it as the liberal won over the democratic party.
> But people back then would probably not understand it


## The Literary Context
* the context within the text (*word only have meaning in sentences*)
* the most important question to ask at every part is *"What's the point?"*
    * what does the author say?
    * why does he say it right here?
    * What is he saying next, and why?
* it is important to have a translation that recognizes poetry and paragraph

### The Question of Content
* the meaning of words, relationship in sentences
* one would usually need good commentary (but this will be the last thing to do)

## Resources and Tools
- a good Bible translation
* a good Bible handbook
* a good translation
* good commentaries
