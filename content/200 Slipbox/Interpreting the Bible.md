## The Need to Interpret the Bible
![[../../The Need to Interpret The Bible|The Need to Interpret]]


## The Aim of Interpretation
* The aim interpretation is to "**get at the plain meaning of the text**"
* The aim of good interpretation is not uniqueness; one is not trying to discover what no one else has ever seen before
* Looking for uniqueness in interpretation can be pointed to pride, or a false sense of spirituality, or vested interest
    * unique interpretation are often wrong
    * uniqueness is not the aim of interpretation
* however due to the [[./The Reader as an Interpreter|nature of the reader]] and the [[./The Nature of Scripture|nature of Scripture]] one can  not just read the bible to get the plain meaning
