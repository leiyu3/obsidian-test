## The Need to Interpret the Bible
![The Need to Interpret](../../The%20Need%20to%20Interpret%20The%20Bible.md)


## The Aim of Interpretation
* The aim interpretation is to "**get at the plain meaning of the text**"
* The aim of good interpretation is not uniqueness; one is not trying to discover what no one else has ever seen before
* Looking for uniqueness in interpretation can be pointed to pride, or a false sense of spirituality, or vested interest
    * unique interpretation are often wrong
    * uniqueness is not the aim of interpretation
* however due to the [nature of the reader](./The%20Reader%20as%20an%20Interpreter.md) and the [nature of Scripture](./The%20Nature%20of%20Scripture.md) one can  not just read the bible to get the plain meaning
