## [[3D Printing|3D Printing]]
I do 3D printing on my free time. I have made several 3D models on my own to make designs that improve or solves problems that I have. The 3D printer that I have is the Ender 3 Pro by Creality that have been further upgraded by myself. For more information go to myÂ [3D printing page](https://leiyu3.github.io/3dprinting.html).

## Exercising/Working out
I mainly do calisthenics. But I use to do weight lifting starting in Grade 10 weigh class. Then I started going to the gym. In grade 12 I think I started getting into calisthenics. And then fully embraced it in 2nd year university when I got a gymnastic ring. 

I also did cross country, and track and field. I used to do long distance running.

Tabata and Hit.
