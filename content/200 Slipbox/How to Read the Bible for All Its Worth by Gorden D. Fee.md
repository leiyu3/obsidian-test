## 2. The Basic Tool: A Good Translation
[[./Bible Translations|Bible Translations]]

### The Science of Translation
* Textual: actually wording of the original text
* linguistic: the theory of translation

#### The Question of Text
* one has to make sure the greek and Hebrew text they are using is as close as possible to the original wordings
* Problem of text in the OT and NT
    1) no original(manuscripts) exits
    2) what exists are thousands of copies, hand copied over a time period of 14 hundred years
    3) most of these copies are from the later medieval time, they are significantly different from the earlier copies and translation
* sift through all of the manuscripts and determine which variants are most likely error and which are most likely represent original text

##### Textual Criticism
* more in depth read: *Biblical Criticism: Historical, Literary and Textual*
1. _Textual criticism is a science that works with careful controls_
    1. external evidence (character and quality of the manuscripts)
        * quality and age of the manuscript
        * OT: choice between the Hebrew(more ancient) and Greek translation ([[../../Septuagint|The Septuagint]])
        * NT: manuscript from Egypt
    2. internal evidence (the kinds of mistakes made by copyists)
2. _Although textual criticism is a science, it is not an exact science, because it deals with too many human variables_
    * when there are multiple good choice of word, good translations will have foot notes
3. KJV
    * at the time of 1611, there is only late manuscrupts for the NT
    * there will be many mistakes, that will make a difference in specific texts
    * should use any other modern translations for study

#### The Questions of Language
* the problem of transferring words and ideas to another language
_Original Language_: the language one is translating from
_Receptor Language_: the language one is translating to
_Historical Distance_: difference that exist between the original language and the receptor language. (In words, grammar, and idioms, and culture and history)
_Theory of Translation_: the degree one is willing to go to bridge the gap between the two language
    * translate lamp to flashlight? do people use lamp the same way as flashlight back then? or just leave it as lamp and let people bridge the gap?
    * _Literal_: keeping the exact words as close as possible
    * _Free_: attempt to translate the idea from one language to another (paraphrase)
    * _Dynamic equivalent_: attempt to translate words, idioms, and grammatical constructions of original to precise equivalent in the receptor
        * keep historical distance in historical and most factual matters
        * "updates" matters of language, grammar and style

| Literal |  |  | Dynamic Equivalence |  |  | Free |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| KJV | RSV | NRSV | NIV | GNV | PHILIPS | LB |
| NASB |  |  | NAB | JB |  |  |
|  |  |  | MEB |  |  |  |

* the best translation method is Dynamic Equivalent,
* a literal translation is helpful as a second translation
* a free translation is helpful to think about the possible meaning of a text
    * One problem with free translation is that it is _always_ done by one translator
* the NRSV, tend to be more gender neutral as so to be politically correct

* How translator deal with Historical Distance:
    1. weighs, measure, money
        * should we use the original word for the measures? "homer"
        * or use modern equivalent? (lb/feet/kg/m)
        * for money, what about inflation?
    2. Euphemisms (for matters of sex and toilet)
        * (1) translate literally, but leave the English reader bewildered or guessing
        * (2) translate literal equivalent, but perhaps offend or shock the reader
        * (3) translate with equivalent euphemism
        * option 3 is best if possible otherwise option 2
    3. Vocabulary
        * choosing the right word
    4. Grammar and Syntax

## 3. The Epistles: Learning to Think Contextually
### The Nature of the Epistles
Form:
    1. Name of writer
    2. name of the recipient
    3. greeting
    4. prayer wish or thanksgiving (sometimes missing, sometimes a doxology)
    5. body
    6. final greting and farewell
* All epistles are _occasional documents_
    * therefore epistle are theology written for a particular need

### The Historical Context
* form a tentative reconstruction of the situation that caused the author to write the epistle
	1. through a bible dictionary or commentary, find out as much as possible about the church and its people
	2. read the whole epistle through one sitting
	    1. what you notice about the recipients themselves
	    2. Paul's attitudes
	    3. any specific things mentioned as to the specific occasion of the letter
	    4. the letter's natural logical divisions
* after breaking the letter in to divisions do step two for the smaller division
* Figure out what is the occasion

### The Literary Context
* now trace Paul's arguments as an answer to the problem found above
* THINK PARAGRAPHS
    * read each paragraph and in a sentence or two explain the point of each paragraph for the argument as a whole
    * or explain how it functions as a part of Paul's answer to the problem
* Figure out Paul's answer to that occasion
1. state the content of each paragraph
2. Why you think Paul says this right at this point. How does this content contribute to the argument?

### Problem Passages
1. Because Paul didn't write the letter to us.
2. Nonetheless, the point of the passage is not lost to us
3. One needs to learn to ask what is _certain_ for a text and what is possible but not certain
4. Use a good commentary
5. _Humility_ we don't know everything

## 4. The Epistles: The Hermenuetical Question
* What do these text mean to us?
* What is culture and what transcends culture?
* Hermeneutic is harder than exegesis because exegesis have a limit to first century settings. Whereas Hermeneutic have no set limit of interpretation 

### Our Common Hermeneutics
* Everyone already do hermeneutics (Common Sense Hermeneutics)
* Problems are text that are in the grey area.
* The problem is our lack of consistency
    * we bring our biases to the text
	    * We end up with "how do we answer" these text so that it fits our view v.s. what does the text actually say?
* **On what grounds**, do we say that a certain text apply to us and certain text doesn't?

### The Basic Rule
* **A Text cannot Mean what It never could have meant to its author or his or her readers**
	* Helps limit what the text means
	* Which is why we need to understand what the text says to it's original readers and authors through [[./Exegesis|Exegesis]]

### The Second Rule
* **Whenever we share comparable particulars (i.e., similar specific life situations) with the first-century setting, God's Word to us is the same as his Word to them**
	* Which is why we need to understand the text well though [[./Exegesis|Exegesis]]

### The Problem of Extended Application
* God's word to us must be limited to it's original intent
* extended application is usually seen to be legitimate because it's true (clearly spelled out in other passage where that is the _intent_ of the passage)
* We are not sure, so can we extend the text to other applications? 
	* Maybe, but only because there are other text where that is the *intent

- [ ] Get Example from Book

### The Problem of Particulars That are Not Comparable
* what to do when Paul talks about situation that doesn't appear (or highly unlikely) in the 21st century
1. We must really know what God's word to them was.
    * In most case a clear _principle_ has been articulated which will transcend the historical particular
    * *stumbling block* principle
1. However we can not apply the *principle* where ever we want
    * we must argue that it apply to _genuine comparable situations_

- [ ] Get example from book

### The Problem of Cultural Relativity
- This is the most difficult part. What part of the text is limited to first century and what part can we take to the present?
	- sometimes it's so conditioned that all recognized it has little or no present significant (What about the Word's Divine and Eternal nature?)
- We already kind of do this, though not well in some cases: "Holy Kiss", "Leave a Little Wine in Water", "Head Covering in Church for Women"
	- Problem is when people bring "homosexuality" into the same ground (no longer significant for us today)
-  It is also extreamly difficult to follow the same "culture" of the first century. And also there is no divine/perfect culture
* Guidelines, to help distinguish between "cultural" and "normative". They are not "once and for all" and can be discussed upon
    1. Distinguish the core message of the bible and what is dependant upon or peripheral to it.
	    - To safe guard the gospel.
		    - From changing to fit cultural expression
		- What is core?
	        * Fallenness of all mankind
	        * redemption form that fallenness as God's gracious activity through Christ's death and resurrection
	        * the consummation of that redemptive work by the return of Christ etc...
			- Etc.
		- What is peripheral?
			- head covering
			- holy kiss
			- charismatic ministry and gifts
    2. Distinguish in the scripture what is defined as inherently moral and what is not
	    - Those that are inherently immoral are for every culture
        * those that are not inherently immoral are therefore expression of culture
        * Paul's sin list for example are always inherently moral (never contain cultural items; 1 Corinthians 6:6-10)
        * Not inherently moral matters
	        * Head covering, foot washing, holy kiss, eating marketplace idol food, women having a head covering when praying or prophesying, Paul's personal preference for celibacy, women teaching in the church. Are not inherently immoral. They become so in their use and abuse in a given context involving disobedience or lack of love.
    3. Take note where the NT itself have a uniform and consistent witness about certain matters and differences about certain matters
	    - Where there is uniformity
		    - love as the Chrsistians' basic ethic response, a nonretaliation personal ethic, the wrongess of strife, gatred, murder, stealing, praciting homosexuality, drunkeness, and sexual immorality of all kinds
		- where there is difference
			- womens' ministries in the church (Rom 16:1-2 where Phoebe is a "daec), the political evaluation of Rome, the retention of one's wealth, eating food offered to idols.
		    - Paul takes offering from certain church, but when working in a different church, he rejects receiving offerings.
			    - Some churches might be poor, some churches might see receiving gift as corruption, not genuine etc...
		- sound exegesis may allow one to see more uniformity, but it should not trump common sense or the plain meaning of the text. One should not be disturbed by the difference, and should not use exegesis to find uniformity. #read_more_about_this 
    4. It is important to distinguish in NT about principal and specific application
	    - NT writers sometimes use an absolute principal to speak about a specific application. This doesn't make the specific application absolute.
	    - 1 Corinthians 11:2-16
    5. Determine the cultural option the writers have during the NT time
	    - If a NT writer takes a cultural option of which there were only one, then the application becomes more culturally relative of such position
        * attitude toward slavery and status of women were singular
        * the writers do not denounce slavery as evil, on the other hand they treat women better compared to their contemporaries
    7. cultural differences that are not obvious
        * example, women usually do not have education opportunities while here it is the norm
        * Rome's government (participatory democracy (bad law to be changed bad leader to be changed) is very different form the government Paul speaks about in Rom 13)
    8. Christian Charity
	    - recognize difficulties
	    - communication, start by defining some principles
	    - love and forgiveness

- Example with [[../../Women as Teacher or Proclaimer of the Word|Women as Teacher or Proclaimer of the Word]]

- Example with [[../../Homosexuality|Homosexuality]]


### The Problem of [[../../Task Theology|Task Theology]]
1. We must be content at times with some limitations to our theological understanding
    * In Scripture God has given what we _need_ but not necessarily all that we _want_
    * 1 Corinthian 6:2-3
	    * Paul, to show the absurdity of going to a non-believer judge, uses the fact that Believers will will day judge the angles. There is only affirmation, not more about it. Beside the affirmation everything else is just speculation.
	* 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 (pg 76-77)
		* Paul says that we are participating in the blood of Christ and the body of Christ, but doesn't say what that participation actually entails.
2. Sometime the problem is that we want the text to answer questions that we ask, but the nature of the epistle is that it was aimed toward their questions
    * e.g. abortion, remarriage, infant baptism      
    * to speak on such topics we need to use the basis of the **whole biblical theology**
    * No [[../../Proof Texting|Proof Texting]]
	- 1 Corinthians 7:1-16
		- v12, (I, not the Lord). Paul is speaking on something that Jesus hasn't spoken on, Divorce between believer and believers.
			- Paul had apostalic authority, but we don't have it

## 5. The Old Testament Narratives: Their Proper Use
* bulk of the bible is of the form of narrative

### The Nature of the Narratives

#### What Naratives Are
* narratives are stories
* God's Story
* Tells us things that happen, show God at work in his creation and among his people
* the narratives glorify him, help us to undrestand and appreciate him
* gives a picture of his providence and protection

#### Three Level of Narratives
* _Top Level_ (Story of Redemption, Redemptive Hisotry)
    * Whole universal plan of God
    * Initial creation itself
    * the fall of humanity
    * the power and ubiquity of sin
    * the need for redemption
    * Christ's incarnation and sacrifice
* _Middle Level_
    * Centers on Israel
    * The call of Abraham
    * The establishment of an Abrahamic lineage throught the patriarchs
    * the enslaving of Israel in Egypt
    * God's deliverance form bondage and the conquest of the promised land of Canaan
    * Isreal's frequent sins and increasing disloyalty
    * God's patient protection and pleading with them
    * the ultimate destruction of orthern Israel and then Judah
    * the restoration of the holy people after the Exile
* _Bottom Level_
    * individual narratives
    * how Joseph's brother sold him into slavery
    * Gideon doubting God
    * David's adultery with Bathsheba
* The bottom level stories should be viewed in light of the other two levels
* there are also compound narratives
    * bottomlevel narratives with even more smaller narratives
* When Jesus say that the scripture bear witness to Him
    * not every single bottom level narrative, but more referring to the top level

#### What Narratives Are Not
1. The OT narratives are not just story about people who lived in OT times
    1. they are first and formost about what God did and thorugh those people
    2. God is the supreme "protagonist" or leading decisive character in all narratives
2. not all allegories or stories filled with hidden meanings
    1. does not answer all our questions on an issue
    2. The narratives does not tell us how and why certain happens and we have to be content with that
3. Do not teach directly
    1. they help us know God by experiencing Him
    2. If you are a Christian, the OT is _your_ spiritual history.
        1. The promises and calling of God to Isreal are _your_ historical promises and calling
4. each individual narratives does not necessarily have a morale on its own
    1. the narratives have to be viewed together as an unit not atomistically

### Principles for Interpreting Narratives
1. An OT narrative usually does not directly teach a doctrine
2. usualy illustrates a doctrine or doctrines taught propositionally elsewhere
3. Narrative records what happen (not necessarily what should have heppend or what out to happen every time. Therefore, not every narrative has an individual identifiable moral of the story
4. what people do in narratives is not neccessarily a good example for us
5. Most of the characters in the OT are far from perfect and their action too
6. We are not told at the end of the narrative whether what happened was good or bad. we are expected to judge base on what God has taught us directly and catogorically elsewhere in the scripture
7. _All_ narratives are selective and incomplete. Not all relevant details are given.
    1. What does appear are what the inspired authors wants us to know
8. Not written to answer all our theological questions
9. can teach us explicitly or implicitly
10. In the final analysis, God is the hero of all biblical narratives

### Warning
* Implicit does not mean secret

### Some Final Cautions
* People read into the narratives wrong things because they are desperate, impatient, they expect that everything in the bible applies directly as instructin for their own lives
* Some common errors in interpreting narratives
1. Allegorizing
2. Decontextualizing
    1. Ignoring the full historical and literary context
3. Selectivity
    1. picking and selecting specific words or phrase
4. False Combination
    1. combining two different parts of the bible while having not direct connection
5. Redefinition
    1. redefining a saying in such a way that are narrow enough to be no longer a threat to the people doing the redefinition
    2. when the plain meaning leaves the reader cold, they tend to redefine it
6. Extracanonical authority
    1. using a another book to or doctrine to figure out the bible
    2. sees the bible as a sereis of riddle needing special knowledge to solve
7. Moralizing
    1. assumption that principle of living can be derived form all passages
8.Personalizing

## 6. Acts: The Question of Historical Precedent
* include everything from ch5
* expands upon how to read narratives
* Luke's intention on writing Acts is the same as the Holy's Spirit's intention in writing Act

### The Exegesis of Acts
* people come and read acts with different motives, to know about history, to prove the bible by using good historical accounts, using the early church as a model
    * cause people to be selective

#### Acts as History
* conintuation of God's story from OT
* _What happened?_ and _What was Luke's purpose in selecting and shaping the material in this way?_
* What and Why

#### The First Step
1. Read the while book in one setting and ask questions
2. take notes of key people and places, recurrig motifs (What really intrests Luke?), natural division of the book
3. go back and skim read, jot down with reference of previous observations
4. Ask. Why did Luke write this book?

#### Acts: An Overview
* 1:1-6:7
    * discription of the primitive church in Jerusalem
    * its early preaching, common life, spread and its initial opposition
    * Very Jewish
    * concludes with conflicts between the Greek speaking and Aramaic-speaking believers
* 6:8-9:31
    * First geographical expansion, carried out by "Hellenists"
    * conversion of Paul. Who will lead the expansion to the gentiles
    * Stephen's martyrdom is key to the inital expansion
* 9:32-12:24
    * description of the first expansion to the Gentiles
    * key is the conversion of Cornelius(that his conversion is the direct act of God)
        * God used Peter to convert Cornelius
    * story of the Antioch church
* 12:25-16:5
    * first geographical expansion into the Gentile world
    * Jews now regularly reject the Gospel becuase it includes Gentiles
    * The church meet in council and does not reject its Gentile brothers and sisters nor put jewish religious requirement on them
* 16:6-19:20
    * further, westward expansion into the Gentile world
    * Jew rejects and Gentile welcomes the Gospel
* 19:21-28:30
    * events that lead Paul into Rome
    * Focus on Paul's trials
* The Holy Spirit was the leading character in Act

#### Luke's Purpose
1. The momentment lead the holy spirit of the Gospel being Jerusalem based into a global gentile based phenomenon
2. Not to tell of the Apostles lives(biography) and no intrest on church organization or policy
    1. didn't include all of the church expansions (Crete, Illyricum, Pontus.....
        1. church history was not Luke's purpose in writing Acts
3. Purpose was not to standarize things
4. To serve as a model, but not of the specific things
    1. God's propelling forward of the Gospel from Jerusalem to prodominently Gentile
    2. as a model for the church to continue
    3. that nothing can stop this because it is God's intent for the church

#### An Exegetical Sampling
* _What is the point of this narrative or speech?_
* _How does it function in Luke's total narrative?_
* _Why has he included it here?_

### The Hermeneutics of Acts

#### Some General Principles
* Assumption
    * Unless Scripture explicitly tells us we must do something, what is only arrated or descrived does not function in a normative way -- unless it can be demonstrated on other grounds that the author intended it to function in this way.
* Intent
* Incidental

#### Some Specific Principles
1. It is probalby never valid to use an analogy based on biblical precedent as giving biblical authority for present-day actions.
    * example, using Gideon's fleece as finding out God's will. Ngiven no biblical authority
2. In the case where the precedent justifies a present action, that the prescedent does not establish a norm for specific action.
3. In matter of Christian experiece, and even more so of Christian practice, _biblical precedents may sometimes be regarded a repeatable patterns - even if they are not understood to be normative_.

## 7. The Gospels: One Story, Many Dimensions
* "the kingdom of God"

### The Nature of the Gospels
* difficulties
    1. Jesus did not write a gospel
    2. there are 4 gospels
* Books about Jesus
* Why four?
    * different christian communities each had need for a book about Jesus
* _In each case the intreste in Jesus is at two levels_
    1. historical concern of this is who Jesus was and what Jesus did, and this is what He said.
        * it is this Jesus who was crucified and raised form the dead, whom we now worship as the risen and exalted lord
    2. existential concern of retelling this story
        * retelling of Jesus in other settings

### Historical Context
* awareness of the culture and religion of the first century.
* understand the particular context of a saying or parable
* the individual authors and thier reson for writing

#### The Historical Context of Jesus -- In General
* Immerse in the first century Jusaism
    * Ex., knowing what the Sadducees believe, and why and why jesus had so little contact with them
        * they don't believe in ressurection
* _Jerusalem in the Time fo jesus_, Joachim Jeremias
* _The NewTestament Environment_, Eduard Lohse
* _Jesus's Audience_, J. Duncan M. Derrett
* The _form_ of Jesus' teaching
    * parables
    * master of purposeful overstatement (hyperbole) Matt 5:29-30, Mark 9:43-48
        * learn from what he _means_ not what he _says_
    * Proverbs, similes and metaphors
        * Matt. 6:21, Mark 3:24
        * Matt 10:16; 5:13
        * Matt 7:6-8, Luke 6:27-28
    * Questions
        * Matt 17:25
    * Irony
        * Matt 16:2-3
    * _The Method and Message of Jesus' Teaching_. Rober H. Stein

#### The Historical Context of Jesus -- In Particular
* Some of Jesus; saying' is recorded without context
* For these sayings, the author of the gospels have placed them within context
* Question to ask: Whether Jesus' audience for a given teaching was his close disciples, the larger crowds, or his opponents.

#### The Historic Context of the Evangelist
* Though we can't be sure of the details of each author we can be sure of each's autor's intention and purpose when writing the gospel.
    * Mark's Gospel
        * intrested in explaining Jesus' messaiahship
          concern is the suffering-servant nature of Jesus' messaiah ship

### The Literary Context
1. to help exgete or read with understanding a given saying or narrative in its present context in the Gospels
2. to understand the nature of the composition of the Gospels as wholes, and interprete nany of the Gospels itself not just isolated facts about Jesus' life

#### Interpreting the Individual Pericopes
* Think _Horizontally_ and _Vertically_
* _Horizontally_
    * beaware of the parallel in the other gospels
    * intrest is not to full out the details of events
        * distracts us from the interest and concern of each Gospel, and into the historical fact
    * Gives us disctinction between the Gospels
    * give us the different context
    * Matthre and Luke used Mark as its source material
    * Synopsis, _Synopsis of the Four Gospels_ by Kurt Aland
* _Vertically_
    * be aware of the historical context, both of Jesus and of the evangelist
    *

#### Interpreting the Gospels as Wholes
* selectivity, arrangement, and adaptation
* the author and the church setting, made them select certain things to include
    * John, was specificly written that his purpose was theological
        * "that you may believe that Jesus is the Messaiah, the Son of God" John 20:31
* Mark's selectivity
    * chatper 1-3
    * 3 strands of intrests that Mark have
        * popularity with the crowds, discipleship for the few, and opposition from the authorities
        * Jesus growing popularity
        * Opposition from the crowed (The four narratives is common in asking the question why?)
            * Jesus forgives sin
            * eats with sinners
            * neglects the tradition of fasting
            * and "breaks" the sabbath
            * and then adds another one showing that the sabbath was considered by the Jews to the ultimate insult to their tradition by adding another one of this kind

### Some Hermeneutical Observation

#### The Teaching and Imperatives
* Imperatives are not laws that a christian should do them to be saved but how a christian's life should be like because of God's prior acceptance of us
* _In Christiaity religion is grace, and ethnic is gratitude_

#### The Narratives
* Narratives tend to function in more than one way in the Gospels
* The rich young ruler is not teaching believers should sell all their pocessions, but that it is harder for the rich to enter the kingdom. But God can work miracle on the rich too.

#### A Final, Very Important Word
* _One dare not think he or she can properly interpret the Gospels without a clear undertsanding of the concept of the kingdom of God in the ministry of Jesus_

## 8. The Parables: Do You Get The Point?
* Key to understanding the parables it know the original intended audience

### The Nature of the Parables

#### Of Variety of Kinds
* True Parables: Stories
    * Lost Sheep
    * The Good Samaritan
    * The prodigal Son
    * the Great Supper
    * the Laborers in the Vineyard
    * The Rich Man and Lazarus
    * The Ten Virgins
* Similitude: illustratio taken from everyday life that Jesus used to make a point
    * Leaven in the Meal
* Metaphor and Similies:
    * "You are salt of the earth"
* Epigram
    * "Do people pick grapes from thronbuses, or fig from thistles?"

* Because parables are not all the same, there is rules that will work for all of them

#### How the Parables Function
* story parables function to get an response form the hearers
* _calling forth a response_
* Its like telling a joke, and the hearer laughs when he gets it (only if he understands the reference/gets the point)
    * if you explained the joke the joke isn't as funny
    * when it is explained it no longer function in the same way
* "How do we recapture the "punch" of the parables in our own times and our own settings?"

### The Exegesis of the Parables

#### Finding the points of the Reference
1. knowledge of the points of reference
	- This is importance because without a point of reference there will not be a unexpected turn
2. and the unexpected turn in the story

* example Luke 7:40-42

#### The Parables of the Kingdom
* the ones that say "The kingdom of God is like..."
* First, is not to be taken of the first element mentioned in the parable
    * Kingdom of God is not literally a mustartd seed, teasure hiiden in a field
    * should be read a "It is like this with the kingdom of God..."
* Second, it is tempting to treat these parables differntly from other parables
* implicit stating that the Kingdom is already here
    * a sense of urgency of impending judgement
    * Good new that there is grace and mercy offerd to all
* The Unjust Stward
    * he realized that punishment is coming form his master
    * *He acted upon that coming judgement by making all other peoples debt void, thus making firends outside*
    * The master praised the steward for being shroud
    * Jesus does not excuse dishonest work but the point is that the steward did somthigna bout his incoming judegment
    * And so should we

### The Hermeneutical Question
* we don't have the same immediacy that the original hearers have
1. _translate that same point into our own context_
    * telling the story in a more modern sense to in still the same response
2. the fact that all of Jesus' parables are in someway proclaiming the Kingdom
    * _The Presence of the Future_ by George E.Ladd

## 9. The Law(s): Covenant Stipulations for Israel

### Christians and the OT Law
* How are christians today suppose to keep the OT law?
    * Matt 5:18
1. The OT Law is a covenant
    1. covenant between Israel and God
    2. stipilation(law) to obey so that God knows that Isreal is loyal and thus God bless them with protection and etc...
2. The OT is not our testament
    1. the OT is law is not automatically binding to Christians unless it is renewed in the new covenant
    2. loyalty is still required but now is shown differently
3. Some stipulations are clearly not renewed in the New Covenant
    1. The Israelite Civil laws
        1. only applies to ancient Isreal
        2. penalty for crimes etc...
    2. Israelite ritual laws
        1. how Isreal are to worship and offer sacrifice to God
        2. When Christ died, he did the sacrifice once for all
        3. therfore, sacrifice is no longer needed.
        4. Worship in the New Covenant manner is still required
    3. Analogus to a change in contract (chagnes in working condidiont, but similar benefits...)
4. Part of the Old Covenant is renewed in the New Covenant
    1. certain ethical laws in the OT are renewed to support the new Law given by Christ in NT
    2. the aspect of these laws still applicable because they support "Love God with all you heart... and Love your neighbor as yourself"
5. All of the OT law is still the Word of God for us even though it is not still the command for God to us.
    1. God still want us to know about these laws/commandments, even though they are not personally for us
6. Only that which is explicitly renewed from the OT law can be considered part of the NT 'law of Chrsit'
    1. the 10 commandments and the two great commandments are in such category
    2. Gal 6:2, Matt 5:21-37, John 7:23, Deut 6:5, and Lev 19:18

### The Role of the Law in Israel and in the Bible
* the law "brings us to Christ" by letting us see how high God's standards are and that it's impossible to please God without divine aid

#### Apodictic Law
* commands that starts with do and do not (direct commandments)
* the list is not exhaustic, not evey possiblity is mentioned
* but they are a standard of example
* similar to the US constitution,
    * sets the characteristic of justice and freedom in the land
* It is imposible to keep the spirit of the law.
* The pharisees kept the letter but its still not keeping the law
* _The Law shows us how impossible it is to please God on our own._
* reader of the law, humbled knowing how unworhty we are to belong to God. and how great God is for providing us a way.

#### Cauistic Law (case by case law)
* does not apply to everyone
* non are renewed in the new covenant
* What can we learn from such law then (for today Christians)
    * looking at Deut. 15:12-17
        1. we can see that slavery under the old covenant was hardly a harse, brutal condition
            1. letting slaves go free after 6 years
        2. We learn that God loves slaves
        3. slaves can do better when slaved than going free
            1. master provides food, clothing, protection, housing etc...
        4. the master does not own slaves in a total sense
            1. many limitation under the OT law
    * it doesn't matter that the law was for us or about us.
    * we can learn about God's character through them

### The Old Testament Law and Other Ancient Law Codes
* the OT laws shows remarkable advancements compared to the law codes of the ancient times
* the OT laws have no distingtion between class, gender, and status
* in other ancient laws slaves, and women are treated as property
    * noble classes does not suffer any personal hard when doing injustice (such as murder)
* In the OT law murder is wrong for all and each person is resonponsible for his own sin

### The OT Law as Benefit to Isarel
* the law's ability to make on righteouse before God is almost non existent because no one is able keep the law
* but when its purpose was understood properly one can see example of God's mercy and grace to his people

#### The Food Laws
* Example, do not eat pigs ...
1. food prohibited are animals that will most likely carry diesease
2. non economical to raise in the Sinai desert or the land of Cannan
3. food favored in other religious sacrifices
* Isreal's main meat source, lamb, is the least allergenic of all meats

#### Laws About the Shedding of Blood
* sin deserve punishment
* God provides a substitude that the sinner might escape death
* sets precedent for Christ's redemptive work

#### Unusal Prohibition
* example, cooking a young goat in it's mother's mult, do not make different kind of animals, do not plant your field with two kinds of seed
* designed to forbid the Isreal from engage in the fertilty cult practices or the Cannaites (fertility magic)
* God designed the law to keep the Isreal's from doing non sense

#### Laws Giving Blessings to Those Who Keep Them
* all laws if kept will bring blessing
* a vehicle of good practice

### In Summary: Some Dos and Don'ts
1. Do see the OT law as God's fully inspired word fo you
    Do not see the OT laws as God's direct command to you
2. Do see the OT law as the basis for the Old Covenant, and therefore for Israel's history
    Do not see the OT law as binding on Christians in the New Covenant except where specifically renewed
3. Do see God's justice, love, and high standards revealed in the OT law
    Do not forget to see that Go'ds mercy is made equal to the serverity of the standards.
4. Don't see the OT law as complete. It is not technically comprehensive.
    Do see the OT law as a paradigm - providing examples for the full range of expected behavior
5. Do not expect the OT law to be cited frequentluy the the prophets or the NT
    Do remember that the essence of the law (10 Commandments and the two cheif laws) is repeated in the prophets and renewed in the NT
6. Do see the OT law as a generous gift to Israel, bringing much blessing when obeyed.
    Do not see the OT law as a grouping of arbirary annoying regulations limiting people's freedom.

## 10 The Prophets: Enforcing the Covenant in Israel

### The Nature of Prophecy
* difficult to interprete beacuse we need understand their _form_ and _function_

#### The Meaning of Prophecy
* prophecy in the OT did not just mean predicting the furture.
* about less than 1 percent of the prophetic book are about future events
* and most of them are about Isreal's immediate future not our future

#### The Prophets as Pokespersons
* primary function of the prophets are to speak on behalf of God
* many the prophetic books are a collection of oracle.
* Without the context of time and gistorical setting.
* and not knowing when it ends and when it starts

#### The Problem of History
* hard for us to understand the prophets because we are so historically, culturally, religiously distance from ancient Israel

### The Functiuon of Prophecy
* The Prophets were covenant enforcement mediators
    * the prophets spoke on behalf of God about the blessing and curse of the covenant if Israel obeys or disobeys his laws.
    * based on Leviticus 26, Deut 4, and deut 28-32
    1. identification of Israel's sin, or of God's love for her
    2. a predition of curse or blessing depending on circumstance
* The prophet's message was not their own, but God's
    * it is God who raised the prophet, if a prophet is self proclaimed (false prophet0
    * the prophet proclaims God's message as God sees it
* The prophets' message is unoriginal
    * the prophets' message is the same that God gave to Moses
    * Deut 18:18 "I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers"

### The Exegetical Task

#### The Need for Outside Help
* Bible dictionaries, provide historical setting on each book, outline, special features, issues of interpretation
* commentaries
* bible handbooks

#### The Hostorical Context
* the larger context
    * the prophetic books only cover a small part of Isrealites' history
    * covenant enforcement mediation
        * unprecedented political, military, economic, and social upheaval
        * an enormous level of religious unfaithfulness and disregard fo the ortiginal Mosaic covenant
        * shifts in populations and national boundaries
    * the divide of Isreal, into Isreal(Ephraim), and Judah
    * and the exile of Isreal and Judah
* specific context
    * date, audience, situation

#### The Isolation of Individual Oracles
* THINK ORACLES

#### The Forms of Prophetic Utterance
* The Lawsuit
    * allegorical
    * Isa. 3:13-26, convenant lawsuit
    * judge (God)
    * defendant (Israel)
    * a summons, a charge, evidence, and a verdict
* The Woe
    * allegorical (not all are)
    * accouncement of distress
    * predicts disaster
* The Promise
    * "salvation oracle"
    * reference to future
    * mention of radical change
    * mention of blessing

#### The Prophets as Poets
* poetry makes things easier to learn
1. Synonymous Parallelism
    * the second or subsequent lines repeat or reinforce the first line
    * "I have swept your offenses like a cloud,
        your sins like the morinng mist." Isa 44:22
2. Antithetical Parrallelism
    * the second or subsequent lines contrast the first line
    * "They do not cry out to me from their hearts,
        but wail upon their beds." Hosea 7:14
3. Synthetic Parallelism
    * the second or subsequent lines adds to the first line
    * "Deliverers will go up form Mount Zion
        to govern the mountains of Esau.
        Abd the kingdom will be the Lord's." Obadiah 21

### Some Hermeneutical Suggestion

#### A Caution: The Prophet as Foreteller of the Future
* most of the OT prophets when talking about the future is about more immediate futures of Israel and other nations
* often 'end time' language is used.... such as Eze 37:1-14, raising of the dead, yes it will happen at end time, but it's talking about the return of Israel form exile

#### A Conern: Prophecy and Second Meanings
* Paul sometimes reference OT and give it a 'fuller meaning' (sensus plenior)
    * moses and Israel been given water from God
    * Paul explained it as a encoutner with Christ
* We our selves can not get the 'sensus plenior'
    * Paul has been inspired by God to have the relevations
* "Sensus Plenior" is a function of inspiration, not illumination
* Illumination is insight to understand what the authors wrote

#### A Final Benefit: The Dual Emphasis on Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy
* orthodoxy: correct belief
* orthoproxy: correct action
* God calls Israel to balance of correct belief and correct action
* the same is true fot the New Covenant (James 1:27, 2:18, Eph. 2:8-10)

## 11 The Psalms: Israel's Prayers and Ours
* the Psalms is God's word to us to Him

### A Special Note on the "Imprecatory Psalms"
* verbalization of anger towards others to God
* we all have angry thoughts
    * but the bible tells us to not sin
    * "be angry but not to sin" Ps.4:4
    * Eph 4:25-26
* Imprecatory psalms helps us to express our feeling to God while also directing them to a more healthy thought
* Psalsm 137:7-9
    * the Israel is calling out due to their exile
    * "It is mine to avenge, I will replay" Deut 32:35
    * calls for judgement _according to the covenant curses_
* Does not contradict Jesus' command to love our enemies
    * bible teaches that we are to do love, not to feel love
    * the imprecatory psalms helps us to feel anger, but not to do anger
* "hate" as despide or unable to put up with. Otherwise "Esau I hated" Mal 1:2 would make God a sinner.

### Some Concluding Hermeneutical Observation

    * as oppurtunities to speak to God using the words he inspired other to speak to him

#### Three Basic Benefits of the Psalms
* as a guide to worship
* demonstrate how we can relate honestly to God
* importance of reflection and meditation upon things that God has done for us

#### A Caution
* The psalms do not guarantee a pleasant life

## 12: Wisdom: Then and Now

### The Nature of Widsom
* wisdom is the ability to do Godly choices in life

#### Abuse of Wisdom Literature
1. People fail to read the wisdom literature in context
2. People fail to understand the meaning of certain terms
3. People fail to follow the whole argument of a wisdom discourse

#### Who is Wise?
* our life is made up of our choices
* the bible states that the only good choices are godly choices
    * "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"
* Godliness ~= Wisdom

#### Teachers of Wisdom
* in ancient Israel there were people who taught wisdom

#### Widsom in the Home
* parents actually teaches their child wisdom
* (not run across the street, dress warmly, how to behave, etc..)
* usually concerned with well-being, but should acknowledge that the wisest thing one can do is to please God(do God's will)

#### Wisdom Expressed Through Poetry
* poetry makes thing easier to remember

#### The Limits of Wisdom
* not all wisdom is godly or orthodox
    * not all wisdom stem from God being the source
* wisdom only under the obedience of God serves its purpose

### Ecclesiastes: Cynical Wisdom
* the Ecclesiates seem so cynical.
* WHY?
* Ecc 12:13-14
* Ecclesiastes gives the world view if there was no God, or that God does not interact with his creations
    * which is a very cynical place, where no matter what you do, nothing matters
    * it would leave you cold, and un satisfied
* But the last two verse gives contrast
    * God is the living God
    * "Fear God and Keep his commandments.."

### Wisdom in Job
* what happens in life is not because God thinks its fair or right
* Job's comforters conveys the 'wisdom' that what happens in life is due to the choices we make
    * cause and effect: if you do good God will do good to you, if you do bad God will do bad to you
* But the bible teaches that the world is fallen and often times what happens is not what God desires to happen
* God's way is above our way, his allowing for suffering does not mean that he doesn't know what he is doing or, or that he should be questioned

### Wisdome In Proverb
* Teaches wisdom/attitude that will make one into an responsible adult
    * not an guarentee
* life of wisdom and life of folly is constantly being compaired
* Proverb does not predomnantly contain religious words/phrases
    * not everything have to be religious to be godly
    * God made everything to be good

#### Use and Abuses of Proverb
* the Proverbs are written in small, statements with rythms to make it easier to remember
    * but not very specific, and not easy to interpret
* not to be taken literally
    * figurative language and describe things suggestively
* 'promises' in Proverbs is really just a general truth
    * Proverb 16:3
        * the person will be successful in God's definition of success not the world's

### Some Hermenuetical Guidelines

#### Proverbs Are Not Legal Guarantees From God
* the proverbs does not tell wisdom in a literall, technical, way

#### Proverbs Must Be Read as a Collection
* we have to balance proverb reading with other proverbs and the whole scripture

#### Proverbs are Worded to be Memorable, Not to Be Theoretically Accureate
* the more brief, and short the proverbs is the more common sense and thought is needed to understand it
* usually impart an image because images is easier to remember than words

#### Some Proverbs Need to Be "Translated" To Be Appreciated
* some time the langauge used in proverbs are not used in modern times
* some "translation" is needed to understand
    * the meaning will stay the same

1. Proberbs are often parabolic, i.e., figurative, pointing beyond themselves
2. Proverbs are intensely practical, not theoretically theological
3. Proverbs are worded to be memorable, not technically precise.
4. Proverbs are not designed to support selfish behavior - just the opposite!
5. Proverbs strongly reflecting ancient culture may need sensible "translation" so as not to lose their meaning
6. Proverbs are not guarantees from God, but poetic guidlines for good behavior
7. Proverbs may use highly specific language, exaggeration, or any of a variety of literary techniques to make their point
8. Proverbs give good advice for wise approaches to certain aspects of life, but are not exhaustive in their coverage
9. Wrongly used, proverbs might justify a crass, materialistic lifestyle. Rightly used, proverb will provide practical advice for daily living.

### Wisdom in the Song of Songs
* concerns with the wisdom of who to love, and how to love
* two common mistakes when interpretating song of songs
    * totality transfer
        * the mindset that whenever a word is used all its different facet of meaning is implied
        * "love" for example, can mean romantic love or just "I love peanut butter kind of love"
        * thinking "for God so loved the world" in a romantic conotation
    * allogorizing
        * because songs in the prophets were similar to the songs here scholars parcticed totality transfer by allogorizing
        * the prophets were talking about God's love with Israel and how Israel accepeted or rejected God's love
        * reading the love between the man and the women as the love of God with Israel
* But the song of songs is directly concerned with the love between a man and a women
* The overall ethic context of songs of songs
    * monogamous, heterosexual mirrages is what the song of songs talked about
* The genre of Song
    * song at weddings, talk about not attraction in marriage
    * staying faithful to each other, etc..
* Read the Song of Songs as suggesting right choices than perscriptive (giving technical advices)
* The book is very different from the world as it talks about "romance" that continues through out marriage and staying faithful and attracted to the other partner while fullfilling thier needs

## 13 The Revelation: Images of Judgment and Hope
* we have to come to Revelation with humility, there's a lot of things here we don't understand
* exegesis therefore is very important here

### The Nature of Revelation
* Revelation is unique in that it is a blend of three different genres
    * letter(Epistle)
    * prophecy
    * apocalypse
* apocalypse is hard for us to read because we don't have any writting today that we can compare to (new and different for us)

#### The Reveleation as Apocalypse
* because Apocalypse was genre back then it had a certain form and structure
1. the root of apocalypse was OT prophetic writing (Daniel, Ezekiel, etc..)
    * its focus was on God's coming judgement and salvation
    * written during time of oppresion or persecution
    * how God will bring the end of history, and thus the final judgement, and triumphant of right
2. apocalypse was a literature that has form and strucutre
3. cryptic and symbolic language, visions and dreams are literary devices used in the apocalypse
    1. usually pseudonymity is used
4. images in apocalyptic are usualy fantasy than reality
5. very well structured
    1. use of numbers, arragned in sets that when put together express something
* The revelation of John fits all of those quality except for psudonymity (John is clearly written as the writter)

#### The Revelation as Prophecy
* not just to tell of the future but that the future is begining now with the coming of Jesus
* the seven letter also acts as prophetic imprint

#### The Revelation as Epistle
* this means that there's an occasional to which the letter was sent

### The Necessity of Exegesis
1. to understand what the original intent of the letter means
    1. what did John want the readers to know? What the original reader of these would have understood
2. since Revelation is prophetic it could have a second meaning, inspired by the Holy Spirit. but this is outside of the scope of exegesis, thus the focus will be on the original intent of the letter
3. not to overuse "analogy of scripture" (scripture can be interpreted through other sciptures)
    1. we shoudn't feel like we must use other scriptures to understand Revelation
    2. because the original reader shouldn't have to had read 1 Cor, or 2 Thess, to understand the meanings
    3. therefore to understand Revelation, its meanings should be intrinsic or can be gotten from the historical context
4. Because of imagery there are added difficulties"
    1. having a rich background of the ideas and images used in Revelation (mustly found in OT)
    2. there are imageries of several kind
        1. some that have consistencies thorugh out the book
        2. some changes
        3. some refer to specific things
    3. when John interprets these imges, those imgaes must be held firmly and used as the starting place
        1. 1:17-18, Christ him self
        2. the 7 lampstand, the seven churches
        3. 1:20, 7 stars, the seven angle; messengers of the church
        4. 12:9, dragon = Satan
        5. 7 heads, 17:9, 7 hill which the 7 women sits on(as well as the 7 kings)
        6. 17:18, the harlot, a great city = Rome
    4. the imageries are to be viewed as a whole, not focusing to much on the details
        1. sometimes the imageries are used as dramatic effects
        2. sometimes it is used to add detail so the reader can't miss the point of reference
    5. Revelation does not aim to answer all the quesitons about the future
        1. but it shows that God is in control despite present situations
        2. God will judge evil and save his people

### The Historical Context
* read it in one sitting, get the big picture
* was written during persecution, concerning the Gospel
* _tribulation_ and _wrath_
    * tribulation, (death, suffering)
    * wrath, God's judgement
* 6:9-17
    * how long oh lord until you judge the earth?
        * wait a bit longer
        * judgement is certain
* Who can stand?
*  those who had been washed white with the lamb's blood

### The Literary Context
* the function of the visions
* think paragraphs
* Chapter 1-3, sets the scene and shows the important character
    * John, our narrator, who had been exiled due to his faith
    * Christ(1:12-20)
    * Church
* Ch 4-5, also helps to set the stage
    * the church is reminded that God's 'lion' is a 'lamb' who has redeemed mankind though suffering
* Ch 6-7, the actual drama unfolds
* Ch 8-11, reveal God's judment (big picture)
* Ch 12 -22, more detailed

### The Hermeneutical0 Questions
* God does not promise freedom from suffering but triumphant through it
* A message of comfort and encouragement for Christians who are suffering
* How do we interpret the fulfillment of the signs/vision?
    * they are not to be taken literally(the visions)
    * imageries that was used to shown the certainty of God's judgment does not mean 'soon-ness', more like 'limited'


## Appendix: The Evaluation and Use of Commentaries

### The Evaluation of Commentaries
* you would want to have a good commentary for individual books of the bible.
* commentaries that covers multiple books usually goes through what we went thorugh in the book
* the questions the you want the commentaries to answer are:
    1. help on sources and information about historical context
    2. answers to those manifold content questions
    3. thorugh discussions of difficult text, with possible meaning and supporting arguments
* you do not use how well you agree to the author to evaluate a commentary
* commentaries should help you in _exegesis_, telling you what the bible means. Not how to apply it in our present day
* Here are list of points:
    * basic point of informaiton
        1. is the commentary exegetical, hermeneutical, or both?
        2. is the commentary based on the Hebrew, or Greek text or an English translation?
            1. if english, does the author know the original text well? and does he use it as the real source of comments
    * **The Most Important Points**
        1. does the commentary give you multiple interpretations of a difficult text, and give you all the arguments for and against all the possible interpretations
    * Other points:
        1. does the author discuss text-critical problems?
        2. does the author discuss historical background information of ideas in the text at important places
        3. does the author give bibliography so you can further your study if you wish?
        4. does the hitorical information in the begining give you enough info so you can understand the occasion of the book?
* An easy way to evaluate all this is just to use the commentary against a difficult text
    * 1 Cor 11:10, or 7:36
    * 1 Tim 2:15
    * Gen 2:17
