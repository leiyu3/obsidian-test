Hermeneutics seeks the contemporary relevance of ancient texts; the here and now.
* What do these text mean to us?
* What is culture and what transcends culture?

### Our Common Hermeneutics
* Everyone already do hermeneutics (Common Sense Hermeneutics)
* Problems are text that are in the grey area and our lack of consistency
	* We bring our biases to the text

We don't want to start with the here and now until we got [good exegesis](./Exegesis.md) because the proper control for hermeneutics is found in the original intent of the biblical text.

* this keep people from interpreting the text wrong
    * such as the Mormon's baptizing of the dead based on 1 Corinthians 15:29
    * prosperity gospel based on 3 John 2
    * etc...

## Two Basic Rules
1. A text can never mean what it never meant
    * what about additional/fuller meaning of a text just like how NT sometimes expands on OT prophecies
        * it is possible, but we have to know who is the authority, we have be concerned when someone says that they have God's deeper meaning of a text
2. For comparable particulars (similar life situations), God's word to them is the God's word to us.

## Guideline in Hermeneutics
- Extended Application
	- God's word is always limited to its original intent, can't make God's word mean what it doesn't
- Particulars that are not Comparable
	- Then we use the principle
	- Know what is certain and what is not certain but possible
- Cultural Relativity
	- Guidelines...
- Task Theology
	- Use the whole bible to get principles that would apply.
	- Since it's written to first century Christians, the problem they were facing were probably different from ours
	- Humility in that we don't know everything, and don't have all the information provided to use. God gave us what we need, and not necessarily what we want.
