* Everything is interpreted, the problem lies in that we believe our own interpretation and think its the author's intent
* We bring our experience, culture, and prior understandings of words and ideas into the text

### Examples
> [!EXAMPLE]- "Cross"
> Most modern people would picture a cross being "+" shape, while back then during the time of the NT it would have been a "T" shape

> [!EXAMPLE]- "Church at Worship"
> When Christian and Catholics hear "Church at Worship", they envision people sitting in a building with pews. But that's not likely the case back in biblical time.

> [!EXAMPLE]- "Flesh"
> When Paul says (KJV) "Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lust thereof" (Rom 13:14). Most english speaker would think flesh as in body. Therefore, Paul is talking about bodily appetite. However the word "flesh" does not mean body but "the sinful nature" which has a spiritual connotation 

* The English bible itself is an interpretation
* Example from the church
    * 1 Cor 14:34-35, some argue that women should be silent in church, but deny the validity of speaking in tongues and prophecy, both from the same section
    * 1 Cor 11:2-16, women should pray and prophesy, but deny that they should do so with their head covered
    * Baptism by immersion, others make biblical case for infant baptism
    * "eternal security" and "losing one's salvation"
