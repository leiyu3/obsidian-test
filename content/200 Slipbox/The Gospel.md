## Intro
If you want to understand what Christians believe and I mean what true Christians believe. And you have heard of the word 'Gospel' and have no idea what it means. Then I welcome you to sit with me and read this article that I have wrote.

[Christian](../../Christian.md), in its name, is about Christ. The person, work, and promise of Christ. Christian believes Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, who is the promised Messiah that God have promised long ago. He have lived, preached, died, and rose again. As written in the Bible.

The Gospel, is derived from Greek the word 'Ευαγγέλιο' (pronounced euangelion). Which means "good news". Christians have a very good news to share. You can read about the Gospel from the Bible found in Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John. But references to the gospel and Jesus can be found all through out the Bible.

To understand the Gospel is to understand who Jesus is, what He has done, and what He promised to do. And to do that you would also need to understand who God is.

## 1. [Who is God?](../../Who%20is%20God.md)
God is Holy.
God is Just.
God is Creator.


## 2. The Problem of Sin
Man is sinful.

John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  

Rom 5:1 Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  

John 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.  

God is a holy God, he can have nothing to do with sin. And we are all guilty of being sinners. There is nothing in us that can do good because we are by nature sinful. And there is nothing we can do to become righteous before God again. Thus, through sin we are separated from God and far from God’s plan and purpose for us. God is also a just God, that means that as sinners we will also be judged. And the penalty for sin is death.

Prov 14:12 There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.  
Isa 59:2 but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.  

## 3. Jesus Christ

So what can a sinner do before a holy and just God? There is nothing we can do to be right before God. This is why Jesus came down to earth. He came as the sacrificial lamb to die for us. He lived a perfect life as both man and God. That means he lived with no sin. He did all things, thought all things in the way that God wanted him. As human he was tempted but as God he did not fall into temptation. And died so he can be a perfect sacrifice. And became a propitiation for us. He took our sin and transgressions and died in the place of us. And then he raised again three day later. Thus, he satisfied God’s wrath and defeated the power of sin and death. Moreover, he imputed his righteousness on us so that now our standing before God is righteous. Therefore, God’s justice and love was satisfied on the cross. We are saved by grace alone through Jesus’ death.

1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,  

1 Pet 3:18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,  

Rom 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  

Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

1 Cor 15:3-44 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  

## 4. You

Now because of what Christ has done, we now have a way to be made right with God. Jesus said that who ever believes in him and puts his trust in his death and resurrection shall not perish but have eternal life. This mean to set Jesus as your Lord and Savior. Are you ready? You might die any moment so take think about this now. And make a choice. He is waiting for you.

Rev 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.  

John 14:6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  

John 1:12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,  

John 3:3 Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
