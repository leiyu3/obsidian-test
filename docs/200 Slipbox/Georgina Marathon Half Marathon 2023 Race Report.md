### Goals
Since it was my first half marathon, my first goal was to finish.
And aiming for sub 2 hours but I overestimated my own ability.
But this at least gave me a bench mark and will help me to set my future goals.

| A | Finish | *Yes* |
| B | Sub 2:20 | *Yes* |
| C | Sub 2 hour | *No* |

### Training

I used to run 5k in Cross Country back in high school.
My time for 5k was around 35 min, and 10k was about one hour nineteen minutes back in high school.
It has been about 6 years since the last time I did long distance running.
So that's the level my cardio is at when I started.

#### November 2022 to May 2023
I started training for the half marathon since the November of 2022.
From November to April, doing easy runs to slowly building up my mileage.
At the same time I was also doing resistance training with body weight exercises, training for the Spartan 5k Sprint on May 13.

#### April 2023 to August 2023

Starting from April, I started following the half marathon plan provided by Garmin.
Running four times a week, with the long run on Saturday.
24 weeks in total for the plan and the taper starts two weeks before the race date.

Below is my monthly mileage leading up to the race.

|Month| Mileague(km)|
|-----|------|
|November|20|
|December| 35 |
|January| 46 |
|February|70 |
|March| 87 |
|April| 81 |
|May| 86 |
|June| 120 |
|July| 143 |
|August| 132 |

### Pre-race
Got a good 8 hour of sleep 2 night before.
On the day of the race got about 7 hour of sleep waking up at 5:30am to get ready to go to the race.
Ate 5 graham crackers to get some fuel, and made sure I drank water.

### Race

#### 1-10km
I planned to do a negative split. So I started 'slow'.
And was passing lots of people in the beginning.
Feeling really good for the first 7km.
After the 7km mark is when I started to fall off my pacing strategy.
  
#### 11-21km
After the 15km mark I had to really push to keep going.
I kept telling myself I have already put in so much work, I better do my best.
  
At the last kilometer, my right calf and left shin was starting to cramp.
Once I saw the finish line I started to sprint, and finished the race strong.
I was really exhausted.

### Post-race
After the race I went to look for water, banana, and a place to lean on.
Ate more graham cracker, got more water.
I was light headed and dizzy.
But I was glad I finished the race.

### Thoughts

I heavily overestimated my ability, before the race I thought I can finish the race under 2:10.
But I was humbled by the end.

Will have to change my pacing strategy for my next half marathon.
Hoping it will help my time as well.

Overall, it was lots of fun, seeing people of all levels all trying their best.
Would do it again, and hope to run it under two hours next time.
