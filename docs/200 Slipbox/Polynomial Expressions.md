Poly: many
nomial: term

Polynomial stands for many terms.

$$
-3x+2+2x-4+5x^2
$$

| Terms | Coefficients | Variables |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $-3x$ | $-3$ | $x$ |
| $2$ | $2$ | $x^0=1$ |
| $2x$ | $2$ | $x$ |
| $-4$ | $-4$ | $x^0=1$ |
| $+5x^2$ | $5$ | $x^2$ |

## What is a term?
A math express separated by `+` and `-`

> [!example]-
> $5x$

Then a polynomial is a math expression with many term
> [!Example]-
> $5x^2 + 4x - 3$ 
> 

### Anatomy of Terms
- Degree of a term
	- the **sum** of exponents on the variables of a term
- Degree of a Polynomial
	- the degree of the term with the highest degree
- variable
	- the 'letter' of the term
- coefficient
	- the 'number' of the term
- constant
	- a term with no variable
	- degree is 0

## What is a Like Term?
- Like terms are terms have the same variables

## Collecting Like Terms
- with like terms you can add or subtract the coefficient to combine/simplify them
- Collecting Like Terms is commonly referred to as simplify

## Distributive Property
- It is easier to show this with an example I think
- Distribution is commonly also referred to as expanding
