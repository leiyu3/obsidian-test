The 66 books of the Bible were originally written in Hebrew (mostly OT), Aramaic (used in some of OT), and Greek (all of NT).

Using a translation of the bible means that one is at the mercy of the interpretation of the translators. And there are no perfect translations. Therefore, it is a good idea to use multiple translations when you are studying a text.

First, pick a good primary/main translation. This will help in memorization, consistency. A good translation will also tell you about the difficulties in translation in the margins/footnotes.

Then, pick translations that you know will differ.

## Examples
> [!EXAMPLE] Example from 1 Corinthians 7:36
> * KJV: "But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
> * NASB1995: "But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin _daughter_, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry."
> * NIV: "If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married."
> * ESV: "If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin."

> [!EXAMPLE] Example from Isaiah 7:14
> - ESV: "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
> - NRSV: "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel."

> [!Example] Example from Psalm 23:4
> - NIV: "Even though I walk through the darkest valley..."
> - ESV: "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death..."

> [!Example] Example from Psalm 23:6
> - ESV: "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
> - NRSV: "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long."
