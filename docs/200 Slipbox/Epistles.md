Majority of the New Testaments are Epistles. And majority of it are written by Paul.
With a few written by James, John, Peter, and Hebrew having an unknown author.

The Western Church really like Epistles since they have an Essay style of writing, specifically [[../../Romans Overview|Romans]]. The style of writing makes it easier to read than most of the writing in the Old Testament (Prophecy, Wisdom, Poetry, Narative). However, there are still some tricky passages in the Epistles that makes interpretation not so simple.

Epistles are **Occasional Documents**. They are theology written with a particular need.

## Form
An epistle usually follows this structure. Though things might be missing.
- Name of Author
- Recipient address
- Prayer wish and/or thanksgiving
- Greeting
- Body
- Final Greeting and farewell

## Exegesis Tips
### Historical Context (Finding the Occasion of the Letter)
- Letters are usually read as a whole. So read the epistle as a whole as well.
- While reading, take note of the following
	- What is the author's attitude?
	- Anything you notice about the recipients?
	- Any mention of what the purpose of the letter?
	- Tracing the arguments: The letter's logical devision 
- The letter usually will tell you what was wrong with the church and the purpose it was written for
	- using a good bible dictionary or commentary to help you learn about the church and the people

### Literary Context (Tracing the Argument)
- Think in paragraphs
	- summarize each paragraph as a sentence or two as the author's argument
- Trace the Author's argument as an answer to the problem/occasion of the letter
- Answer: Why did the author put that particular point at that particular section? And how does it contribute to the author's point?

### Dealing With Problem Passages
Despite doing all those above there will come passages where we just don't know the exact reason why it's there and how we should understand it. Due to lack of historical context. Because the author didn't write the letter to us. However, the point of the letter is not lost to us though, usually just some very tiny points we're missing out on.

1. Learn to ask what is **certain** and what is **not certain but possible**
2. Using a good commentary
3. Humility: We don't know everything

## [[./Hermeneutics|Hermeneutics]] Tips 
- A text can not mean what it never could have meant to the writer and its reader
- For particulars that are comparable (i.e. similar specific life situation), God's Word to us is the same as God's Word to them

### The Problem of Extended application
- When there are comparable particulars and contexts in the 21th century is it right to extend the application?
- God's word to us are always limited to its original intent
- Extended application can seem right because it's true (clear in other text where that is the *intent* of the passage)

### The Problem of Particulars that are Not Comparable
- This section is concerned with texts...:
	- speaks about first century problem with none 21th century counterpart
	- speak about 21th century that could possibly happen, but highly unlikely
1. We must really know what God's word to them was.
	- A clear principle should be apparent, which will transcend the historical particular
2. However, we can't apply the principle where ever we want
	- we must argue that it is a genuine comparable particular

### The Problem of Cultural Relativity
This is a tricky part, not exact rules, but guidelines.
1. Distinguish between the central message of the bible and those that are peripheral to it or dependant on it
	- The Gospel
	- falleness of humanity
	- Redemptive History, death and resurrection of Christ, and return of Christ
2. Distinguish what the Bible list as inherently moral
	- Paul's sin lists are always inherently moral, never containing cultural items
	- On the other hand: hand, foot washing, exchanging the holy kiss, eating marketplace idol food, women having a head covering when praying or prophesying, Paul's personal preference for celibacy, or a women's teaching in the church are not inherently moral matters.
3. Christian Charity
	- recognize that there are difficulties

### The Problem of [[../../Task Theology|Task Theology]]
- Sometimes we just don't know enough. Humility and being content.
	- God gives us what we need, and not what we want
- The text is trying to answer a different set of questions than ours
	- For our topics (abortion, remarriage, infant baptism, etc...) we need to use the whole bible
