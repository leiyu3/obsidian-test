The death bed test, helps you kept you brain thinking about what is important for you.

Imagine you are on your death bed, what regrets do you have? 

If you were to look back:
- What do you want to be remembered for? 
- Will you say you had lived a good life?
- What do you wished you have spent more time on? Spent less time on?

> "Man, I wished I did more of that thing"

I wouldn't want to look back and say that I wasted all those time playing video games.
Most would say they wish they spend more time with their family.
