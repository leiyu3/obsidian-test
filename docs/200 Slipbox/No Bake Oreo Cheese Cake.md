![Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM8kEtZ22Iw) ^c9551e

## Ingredient
- Base
	- 24 Oreo Cookies
	- 70g butter
- Cream Cheese (can be lactose free) 900g or 32 oz
- 150g icing sugar
- 180g whipped cream
- 24-28 Oreo Cookies
- Extra
	- Vanilla extract
	- Sour Cream


## Instruction
- Take out the cream cheese early for them to get close to room temperature so they're easy to fold
- Can add parchment paper at the base and on the side so that it is easier to remove from the spring pan.
1. Making of the base
	- Combine the Oreo baking crumbs and the melted butter and press the mixture into the base of a spring form pan.  
2. Whip the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add the powdered sugar and continue to whip on high speed until well combined.  
3. Fold the whipped cream and the coarsely crushed Oreo cookies into the cream cheese mixture with a rubber spatula just until well combined.  
4. Pour the cream cheese mixture into the prepared pan and smooth out the top.  

- Chill the cheesecake in the freezer for at least 2 hours (4 hours or more is ideal), and remove to room temperature for 20-30 minutes before garnishing with additional whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and crushed Oreo cookies and serving.
