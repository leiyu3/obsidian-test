There is a loneliness epidemic. More people are becoming more and more lonely.

- It's easier to be alone now days
- People are becoming more difficult to be around
- Social Media also generate a sense of loneliness or FOMO

 Loneliness can be advantageous if you choose it. Then it becomes solitude.
 Choosing to do something is different than someone forcing something onto you. Being fired is different from quitting. Being dump is different from breaking up. Going on a fast/diet, is different from someone else forcing a fast on you. These are all basically the same outcome, but they feel different.
